An B-test

Review O
of O
the O
medical O
record O
revealed O
several O
previous O
admissions O
for O
cellulitis B-problem

bacteremia B-problem
. O

Blood B-test
cultures I-test
on O
this O
admission O
and O
were O
positive O
for O
Beta B-problem
streptococcus I-problem
Group I-problem
B I-problem
. O

The O

A B-test
left I-test
lower I-test
extremity I-test
ultrasound I-test

Atrial B-problem
fibrillation I-problem

The O
patient O
's O
development O
of O
atrial B-problem
fibrillation I-problem
was O
believed O
to O
be O
secondary O
to O
infection B-problem
and O
structural B-problem
heart I-problem
disease I-problem
. O

It O
was O
initially O
managed O
with O
intravenous B-treatment
diltiazam I-treatment

and O
it O
was O
later O
managed O
with O
metoprolol B-treatment
and O

with O
a B-problem
markedly I-problem

that O
were O
controlled O

However O
, O
his B-test
rate I-test
proved O
difficult O
to O
control O
despite O
metoprolol B-treatment
and O
diltiazam B-treatment
. O

The O
EP O
service O
was O
consulted O
and O
recommended O
transesophageal B-test
echocardiogram I-test

QT I-problem
prolongation I-problem
and O
no O
effect B-problem
from I-problem
amiodarone I-problem

. O

He O
demonstrated O
several B-problem
asymptomatic I-problem
electrolyte I-problem
deficiecies I-problem

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
begun O
on O
high B-treatment
dose I-treatment
Hydroxyurea I-treatment
, O
with O
a O
gradual O
improvement O
in O
his B-test
white I-test
blood I-test
count I-test
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O

He O
did O
spike O
a B-problem
fever I-problem
and O
began O
Ancef B-treatment
and O
Gentamicin B-treatment
, O
although O
cultures B-test
never O
revealed O
a O
source O
for O
this O
. O

He O
also O
tried O
Amicar B-treatment
and O
continued O
on O
low B-treatment
dose I-treatment
Prednisone I-treatment
. O

His B-problem
headache I-problem
improved O
, O
but O
her O
remained O
profoundly B-problem
weak I-problem
and O
intermittently B-problem
febrile I-problem
with O
dyspnea B-problem
. O

There O
was O
hemoptysis B-problem
and O
intermittent B-problem
gastrointestinal I-problem
bleeding I-problem
, O
while O
he O
remained O
profoundly B-problem
thrombocytopenia I-problem
. O

Transfusions B-test
of I-test
platelets I-test
did O
not O
change O
his B-test
platelet I-test
count I-test
, O
presumably O
because O
of O
sequestration B-problem
and O
a B-problem
massive I-problem
spleen I-problem
. O

Amicar B-test
was O
of O
uncertain O
value O
, O
but O
used O
intermittently O
. O

A B-test
bone I-test
marrow I-test
biopsy I-test
revealed O
the O
transformation O
of O
his B-problem
CMML I-problem
to O
acute B-problem
myelogenous I-problem
leukemia I-problem
, O
and O
given O
his B-problem
other I-problem
underlying I-problem
medical I-problem
problems I-problem
, O
we O
chose O
chemotherapy B-treatment
with O
subcutaneous B-treatment
Cystosine I-treatment
Arabinoside I-treatment
and O
6-Thioguanine B-treatment
, O
which O
he O
tolerated O
without O
incident O
and O
this O
brought O
his B-test
white I-test
blood I-test
count I-test
down O
to O
below O
1,000 O
, O
and O
his O
spleen O
shrank O
noticeably O
, O
but O
he O
still O
could O
not O
maintain O
a B-test
bump I-test
in I-test
platelet I-test
count I-test
with O
platelet B-treatment
transfusions I-treatment
. O

He O
was O
intermittently B-problem
congested I-problem
limiting O
our O
ability O
to O
give O
intravenous B-treatment
fluid I-treatment
, O
for O
his B-problem
hydrea I-problem
, O
although O
we O
kept O
him O
on O
Allopurinol B-treatment
. O

The O
renal O
function O
deteriorated O
somewhat O
, O
hampering O
our O
ability O
to O
give O
him O
his B-treatment
Gentamicin I-treatment
. O

The O
family O
maintained O
an O
extraordinary O
vigil O
over O
the O
days O
of O
his O
hospitalization O
, O
providing O
him O
with O
some O
food O
and O
constant O
attention O
, O
while O
we O
awaited O
the O
results O
of O
his B-treatment
chemotherapy I-treatment
and O
treatment B-treatment
of O
his B-problem
infection I-problem
. O

He O
was O
intermittently B-problem
restless I-problem
and O
somewhat B-problem
confused I-problem
, O
and O
as O
his B-problem
respiratory I-problem
status I-problem
deteriorated O
, O
the O
family O
agreed O
to O
a B-treatment
low I-treatment
dose I-treatment
Morphine I-treatment
drip I-treatment
which O
made O
him O
much O
more O
comfortable O
. O

They O
agreed O
with O
a O

and O
in O
the O

he O
ultimately O
expired O
on O
2/28/94 O

. O

Her B-test
electrocardiogram I-test

R I-problem
wave I-problem
progression I-problem
laterally I-problem
. O

Serial B-test
enzymes I-test
were O

a O
had O
a O
relatively O
short O
stay O
in O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

Throughout O
this O
time O
, O
her B-test
creatinine I-test
continued O

no O
apparent B-problem
deleterious I-problem
effect I-problem
on O
her B-treatment
transplant I-treatment
from O
this B-problem
episode I-problem
. O

Her B-treatment
beta I-treatment

weaned O
down O
. O

Two O
days O
after O
this O
event O

depressed I-problem
left I-problem
ventricular I-problem
systolic I-problem
function I-problem
with O
severe B-problem
posterior I-problem
wall I-problem
hypokinesis I-problem
. O

This O
was O
a O
change O
from O
her B-test
prior I-test
echocardiogram I-test
and O
demonstrated O
evidence O
of O
a B-problem
small I-problem
myocardial I-problem
infarction I-problem
. O

Clinically O
, O
she O
did O
much O
better O
and O
her B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
was O
optimized O
prior O
to O
discharge O

HISTORY O
AND O
REASON O
FOR O
HOSPITALIZATION O
: O

The O
patient O
is O
a O
79 O
year O
old O
gentleman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
an B-treatment
ascending I-treatment
aortic I-treatment
graft I-treatment
replacement I-treatment
in O
1991 O
for O
aortic B-treatment
dissection I-treatment
. O

At O
that O
time O
the O
patient O
's O
hospital O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
a B-problem
sternal I-problem
wound I-problem
infection I-problem
requiring O
a B-treatment
sternal I-treatment
debridement I-treatment
and O
subsequent B-treatment
abdominal I-treatment
flap I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
was O
then O
continued O
by O
report O
on O
Dicloxacillin B-treatment
for O
approximately O
one O
year O
following O
that O
reconstructive B-treatment
operation I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
apparently O
did O
well O
until O
June O
1998 O
when O
he O
noted O
a B-problem
bulge I-problem
in I-problem
his I-problem
sternal I-problem
area I-problem
. O

A B-problem
ruptured I-problem
aneurysm I-problem
or O
pseudoaneurysm B-treatment
at O
the O
junction O
of O
the B-treatment
graft I-treatment
and O
arch O
was O
diagnosed O
and O
this O
was O
subsequently O
repaired O
. O

The O
patient O
then O
had O
recurrent B-problem
bleeding I-problem
two O
weeks O
later O
which O
was O
once O
again O
repaired O
. O

However O
the O
same O
problem O
recurred O
for O
a O
third O
time O
and O
a B-test
computer I-test
tomogram I-test
scan I-test
at O
an O
outside O
hospital O
showed O
an B-problem
anterior I-problem
hematoma I-problem
. O

By O
report O
the O
patient O
was O
at O
that O
time O
told O
that O
there O
was O
no O
more O
that O
could O
be O
done O
for O
him O
and O
was O
then O
apparently O
placed O
on O
comfort B-treatment
measures I-treatment
and O
pain B-treatment
control I-treatment
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
. O

However O
the O
patient O
was O
then O
subsequently O
transferred O
to O
Fairm O
of O
Ijordcompmac O
Hospital O
upon O
request O
of O
the O
family O
on O
8/24/98 O
for O
further B-test
evaluation I-test
and O
possible O
intervention B-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
was O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Rhalt O
of O
Dentvailr. O
Medical O
Center O
. O

As O
the B-test
patient I-test
's I-test
early I-test
evaluation I-test
the O
patient O
underwent O
an B-test
aortogram I-test
which O
showed O
an B-treatment
ascending I-treatment
aortic I-treatment
graft I-treatment
with O
bulging B-problem
flaps I-problem
and O
a B-treatment
pseudoaneurysm I-treatment
at I-treatment
the I-treatment
anastomosis I-treatment
of I-treatment
the I-treatment
graft I-treatment
and O
arch O
just O
below O
the O
great O
vessels O
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
for O
a B-problem
definite I-problem
leak I-problem
but O
there O
was O
evidence O
for O
gas B-problem
bubbles I-problem
in O
the O
anterior O
posterior O
distal O
ends O
of O
the B-treatment
grafts I-treatment
consistent O
with O
an B-problem
infectious I-problem
process I-problem
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Infectious O
Disease O
Service O
who O
upon O
culturing O
the B-treatment
patient I-treatment
's I-treatment
sternal I-treatment
drainage I-treatment
switched O
the O
patient O
from O
intravenous B-treatment
Unasyn I-treatment
to O
Levofloxacin B-treatment
for O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
Citrobacter B-problem
and O
Diphtheroids B-treatment
in O
the B-test
wound I-test
cultures I-test
. O

Subsequent O
to O
starting O
this B-treatment
antibiotic I-treatment
regimen I-treatment
the I-treatment
patient I-treatment
's I-treatment
wound I-treatment
drainage I-treatment
appeared O
to O
subside O
. O

Given O
all O
the O
findings O
on O
the O
aortogram O
and O
the B-test
subsequent I-test
chest I-test
computer I-test
tomogram I-test
scan I-test
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
the O
patient O
's O
only O
real O
surgical O
option O
for O
cure B-treatment
was O
a B-treatment
risky I-treatment
operation I-treatment
that O
involved O
removal B-treatment
and O
replacement B-treatment
of O
the B-treatment
aortic I-treatment
graft I-treatment
probably O
with O
homograft B-treatment
and O
long B-treatment
term I-treatment
antibiotic I-treatment
coverage I-treatment
as O
well O
as O
a B-treatment
plastic I-treatment
surgical I-treatment
reconstructive I-treatment
procedure I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
understood O
the B-problem
risks I-problem
and O
potential O
benefits O
of O
the B-treatment
procedure I-treatment
and O
was O
willing O
to O
proceed O
. O

The O
patient O
otherwise O
complained O
of O
no O

no O

The O
patient O

was O
characterized O
by O
persistent B-problem

as O
time O
went O
on O

as O
his B-test

Subsequently O
on O
postoperative O
day O
no. O
8 O
in O
the O
Intensive O

Unit O
the O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
ready O

to O
the O
Cardiac O
Surgical O
Inpatient O
Service O
. O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
the O
Infectious O
Disease O
Service O
who O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
's O
Jackson O
Pratt B-treatment
drains I-treatment
needed O
to O
stay O
in O
as O
there O
was O
still O
some O
significant B-problem

from O
them O
. O

As O
per O
the O
Infectious O
Disease O
Service O
the O
patient O
was O
continued O
on O
Levofloxacin B-treatment
, O
Vancomycin B-treatment
as O
antibiotic B-treatment

However O
on O
09/08/98 O
the O
Infectious O

Service O
was O
made O
aware O
that O
the B-test
patient I-test
's I-test
intraoperative I-test
cultures I-test
had O
also O
grown O
out O
Mycoplasma B-problem
humilius I-problem
. O

Given O
this O
finding O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
certainly O
need O
long B-treatment
term I-treatment
intravenous I-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
to O
include O
at O
least O
six O
weeks O
of O
Vancomycin B-treatment
and O
then O
subsequent O
Levofloxacin B-treatment
for O
the B-treatment
Citrobacter I-treatment
and O
Mycoplasma B-treatment
as O
well O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
scheduled O
for O
peripherally B-treatment

knowing O
that O
he O
was O
going O

intravenous I-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
. O

This O
was O
placed O
on O
postoperative O
day O
no. O
9 O
without O
any B-problem
difficulty I-problem
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
stable O
on O
his B-treatment
antihypertensive I-treatment
regimen I-treatment
. O

He O
was O
becoming O
more O
mobile O
and O
was O
taking O
a B-treatment
high I-treatment
protein I-treatment
high I-treatment
calories I-treatment
diet I-treatment
which O
he O
tolerated O
well O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
be O
afebrile B-problem
and O
otherwise O
very O
stable O
. O

On O
postoperative O
day O
no. O
12 O
the O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
fallen B-problem
and O
subsequently O
dislocating O
the B-treatment
PIP I-treatment
joint I-treatment
of I-treatment
his I-treatment
left I-treatment
middle I-treatment
finger I-treatment
. O

Subsequent B-test
hand I-test
x-rays I-test
obtained O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
fracture B-problem
but O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Plastic O
Surgery O
Hand O
Service O
. O

The O
patient O
will O
benefit O
from O
splinting B-treatment
of I-treatment
his I-treatment
finger I-treatment
while O
the B-problem
swelling I-problem
subsided O
and O
subsequent O
early O
mobilization O
to O
prevent O
any B-problem
rigidity I-problem
in O
that O
joint O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
seen O
subsequently O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Plastic O
Surgical O
Service O
who O
discontinued O
a O
number O
of O
the B-treatment
patient I-treatment
's I-treatment
indwelling I-treatment
drains I-treatment
but O
they O
felt O
that O
others O
needed O
to O
stay O
while O
the O
patient O
was O
sent O
to O
rehabilitation B-treatment
. O

These B-treatment
drains I-treatment
will O
then O
be O
subsequently O
taken O
out O
by O
Dr. O
General O
upon O
his O
followup O
with O
the O

. O

Prior O
to O

the O

also O
underwent O
an B-treatment

test I-test
while O
the O
patient O
was O
to O
stay O
on O
long B-treatment
term I-treatment
intravenous I-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
otherwise O
continued O
to O
be O
hemodynamically O
stable O
making O
good O
progress O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
the O
patient O
made O
remarkable O
progress O
given O
the O
severity O
of O
his B-problem
disease I-problem

prior O
to O
the B-treatment

The O
patient O

on O
the O
morning O
of O
11/16/04 O
associated O
with O
some B-problem
cough I-problem
, O
apparent B-problem
emesis I-problem
. O

GI O
was O
consulted O
for O
an B-problem
EGD I-problem
, O
however O
, O
while O
she O
was O
in O
the O
Endoscopy O
Suite O
, O
as O
mentioned O
above O
, O
she O
had O
a B-problem
hypotensive I-problem
episode I-problem
, O
which O
responded O
to O
some B-problem
fluid I-problem
boluses I-problem
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
discharge O
, O
she O
was O
stabilized O
to O
the O
point O
that O
she O
could O
have O
her B-problem
EGD I-problem
. O

The O
EGD O
did O
show O
three B-problem
esophageal I-problem
ulcers I-problem
that O
were O
localized O
and O
apparent O
suggestion O
of O
pill B-problem
esophagitis I-problem
. O

Her O
stomach O
and O
duodenum O
were O
normal O
and O
it O
was O
suggested O
that O
she O
change O
her B-treatment
Nexium I-treatment
doses I-treatment
to O
daily O
and O
that O
she O
also O
drink O
plenty O
of O

and O
water O
with O
meals O
, O
sit O
upright O
when O
she O
would O
eat O
her O

4. O
Shortness B-problem
of I-problem
breath I-problem
: O

As O
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
develop O
MRSA B-problem
pneumonia I-problem
that O
was O
started O
to O
be O
treated O
with O
vancomycin B-treatment
and O
she O
did O
also O
develop O
an B-problem
oxygen I-problem
requirement I-problem
the O
day O
prior O
to O
discharge O
. O

At O
most O
, O
her B-problem
oxygen I-problem
requirement I-problem
was O
4-5 O
liters O
and O
on O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
discharge O
, O
she O
was O
satting O
well O
on O
two O
liters O
of O
nasal B-treatment
cannula I-treatment
. O

This O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
her B-problem
pneumonia I-problem
; O
however O
, O
with O
her B-problem
right I-problem
ventricular I-problem
hypokinesis I-problem
, O
it O
is O
also O
possible O
that O
she O
may O
have O
an O
element O
of O
pulmonary B-problem
hypertension I-problem
and O
may O
warrant O
further O
investigation O
as O
an O
outpatient O
, O
for O

, O
with O
chest B-test
CT I-test
. O

5. O
Derm B-problem
: O

Several O
days O
prior O
to O

developed O
some B-problem
erythematous I-problem
rash I-problem
under I-problem
her I-problem
left I-problem
breast I-problem
and I-problem
left I-problem
side I-problem
that O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
yeast B-problem
. O

She O
was O
started O
on O
some B-treatment
Miconazole I-treatment
Cream I-treatment
. O

The B-problem
rash I-problem
was O
always O
localized B-problem
to I-problem
her I-problem
left I-problem
side I-problem
, O
sometimes O
extending O
down O
to O
her O
leg O
, O
but O
never O
on O
the O

The B-problem
rash I-problem
appeared O

CMED O
: O

Patient O
was O
maintained O
on O
insulin B-treatment
, O
D10 B-treatment
and O
glucagon B-treatment
drips I-treatment
to O
maintain O
her O
hemodynamics O
. O

This O
was O
achieved O
with O
good O
effect O
, O
and O
they O
were O
subsequently O
weaned O
off O
. O

Patient O
was O
able O
to O
be O
extubated O
on O
hospital O
day O
three O
. O

Psychiatry O
was O
consulted O
after O
the O
patient O
was O
extubated O
, O
and O
felt O
that O
patient O
had O
a O
high O
suicide O
risk O
, O
and O
plan O
was O
for O
her O
to O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O
Psychiatry O
service O
once O
medically O
stable O
. O

Patient B-test
's I-test
renal I-test
function I-test
remained O
stable O
and O
her B-problem
CKs I-problem
trended O
down O
gradually O
. O

Patient O
remained O
on O
suicide B-treatment
precautions I-treatment
, O
but O
was O
deemed O
not O
to O
need O
ICU B-test
level I-test
monitoring I-test
, O
and O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
floor O
on O
01-11 O
. O

In O
the O
a.m. O
of O
01/08 O
, O
the O
patient O
experienced O
episode O
of O
tongue B-problem
biting I-problem
, O
unresponsiveness B-problem
, O
disorientation B-problem
. O

Was O
loaded O
on O
Dilantin B-treatment
. O

Became O
progressively B-problem
hypoxic I-problem
and O
tachypneic B-problem
throughout O
the O
day O
with O
respiratory B-test
rates I-test
of O
30-40 O
with O
a B-test
max I-test
respiratory I-test
rate I-test
of O
116 O
, O
tachycardia B-problem
to O
120s O
. O

Patient O
subsequently O
was O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
CMED O
CCU O
on O
2017-01-13 O
for O
further B-test
monitoring I-test
. O

Patient B-problem
's I-problem
hypoxia I-problem
was O
felt O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
caused O
by O
pneumonia B-problem
. O

She O
was O
started O
on O
appropriate B-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
. O

Etiology O
of O
patient B-problem
's I-problem
tachypnea I-problem
was O
unclear O
. O

Initially O
, O
the O
patient O
's O
etiology O
of O
seizure B-problem
was O
not O
quite O
clear O
, O
but O
thought O
possibly O
secondary O
to O
alcohol O
and O
benzodiazepine B-problem
withdrawal I-problem
. O

She O
received O
EEG B-test
, O
MRI B-test
, O
LP B-test
. O

Subsequently O
EEG B-test
was O
noted O
to O
have O
no O
seizure B-problem
activity I-problem
. O

MRI B-test
was O
suboptimal O
due O
to O
motion O
artifact O
and O
LP O
was O
unremarkable O
. O

Despite O
absence O
of O
seizure B-problem
activity I-problem
on O
EEG B-test
, O
patient O
was O
continued O
on O
Dilantin B-treatment
. O

Her B-problem
delirium I-problem
was O
felt O
possibly O
secondary O
to O
withdrawal B-problem
versus O
toxic B-problem
metabolic I-problem
, O
but O
gradually O
improved O
slowly O
, O
and O
therefore O
patient O
did O
not O
receive O
treatment B-treatment
for O
barbiturate B-problem
withdrawal I-problem
. O

Her O
mental O
status O
, O
tachypnea B-problem
, O
and O
hypoxia B-problem
all I-problem
improved O
, O
and O
patient O
was O
subsequently O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
floor O
medical O
team O
on O
2017-01-15 O
. O

While O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
the O
patient O
's O
mental O
status O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
improved O
back O
at O
baseline O
compared O
to O
that O
back O
to O
the O
CMED O
CCU O
, O
and O
she O
exhibited O
no O
evidence O
of O
barbiturate B-problem
withdrawal I-problem
. O

She O
was O
continued O
on O
suicide B-treatment
precautions I-treatment
with O
a O
one-to-one O
sitter O
, O
and O
plan O
was O
for O
psychiatric O
admission O
when O
medical O
issues O
had O
resolved O
. O

On O
2017-01-16 O
, O
the O

, O
spontaneous B-problem
breathing I-problem

on O
2017-01-16 O
. O

Patient O
's O
family O
was O
notified O
and O
declined O

the O
sudden O
unexpected O
nature O
of O

death O
, O
the O
medical O
examiner O
was O
contacted O
and O
the O

right I-problem
pectoralis I-problem
muscle I-problem
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
metastatic B-problem
cancer I-problem
. O

The B-test
left I-test
simple I-test
mastectomy I-test
also O
contained O
5.5 B-problem

poorly I-problem
differentiated I-problem
infiltrating I-problem
ductal I-problem
and O
intraductal B-problem
carcinoma I-problem
with O
extensive B-problem
lymphatic I-problem
vessel I-problem
invasion I-problem
. O

Estrogen B-test
receptor I-test
was O
0% O
by O
ERICA O
. O

The O
patient O
developed O
a B-problem
large I-problem
hematoma I-problem
requiring O
surgical B-treatment
drainage I-treatment
. O

Therefore O
she O
had O
a B-problem
Stage I-problem
III-A I-problem
adenocarcinoma I-problem
of I-problem
the I-problem
breast I-problem
. O

Since O
she O
was O
at O
high O
risk O
for O
both O
local O
and O
metastatic B-problem
recurrence I-problem
of O
her B-problem
tumor I-problem
, O
she O
received O
both B-treatment
systemic I-treatment
chemotherapy I-treatment
and O
radiation B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
CMSAP B-treatment
, O
which O
is O
Cytoxan B-treatment
, O
Methotrexate B-treatment
, O
Leukovoranrescue B-treatment
, O
5-FU B-treatment
, O
Adriamycin B-treatment
and O
Prednisone B-treatment
for O
four O
cycles O
. O

There O
were O
no O
dose B-problem
reductions I-problem
for O
mucositis B-problem
or O
myelosuppression B-problem
. O

However O
, O
following O
cycle O
4 O
, O
she O
developed O
a B-problem
flu-like I-problem
illness I-problem
, O
followed O
by O
fever B-problem
, O
nonproductive B-problem
cough I-problem
and O
dyspnea B-problem
on O

. O

ABGs B-test
showed O
a B-test
pO2 I-test
of O
79 O
, O
pH B-test
7.44 O
, O
pO2 B-test
33 O
. O

Chest B-test
x-ray I-test
showed O
diffuse B-problem
interstitial I-problem
infiltrates I-problem
. O

The O
differential O
diagnosis O
included O
viral B-problem
pneumonitis I-problem
, O
Mycoplasma B-problem
, O
Chlamydia B-problem
. O

Basically O
in O
December O
1993 O
, O
she O
returned O
to O
the O
Hem O
/ O
Onc O
Clinic O
with O
chest B-problem
wall I-problem
nodules I-problem
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
tumor B-problem
recurrences I-problem
and O
biopsied O
. O

Although O
she O
had O
mediastinal B-problem
recurrence I-problem
, O
bone B-test
scan I-test
, O
head B-test
and I-test
liver I-test
CT I-test
were O
negative O
for O
metastatic B-problem
disease I-problem
. O

She O
was O
thus O
started O
on O
a B-treatment
Protocol I-treatment
of I-treatment
high I-treatment
dose I-treatment
chemotherapy I-treatment
with O
GCSF B-treatment
and O
peripheral B-treatment
stem I-treatment
cell I-treatment
support I-treatment
. O

Complications B-problem
has O
mainly O
included O
myelosuppression B-treatment
and O
mucositis B-problem
. O

She O
also O
developed O
Klebsiella B-problem
UTI I-problem
after O
the O
second O
cycle O
of O
high B-treatment
dose I-treatment
chemotherapy I-treatment
. O

It O
was O
treated O
with O
gent B-treatment
and O
Cipro B-treatment
. O

Re-staging B-test
done O
in O
April O
1993 O
showed O
a B-problem
decrease I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
pretracheal I-problem
nodes I-problem
with O
question O
of O
some B-problem
lymphangitic I-problem
spread I-problem
versus O
some B-problem
pneumonitis I-problem
. O

In O
May O
1994 O
she O
received O
her O
first O
course O
of O
thiotepa B-treatment
and O
Velban B-treatment
and O
Methotrexate B-treatment
, O
which O
required O
some B-treatment
red I-treatment
cell I-treatment
transfusions I-treatment
. O

In O
mid O
May O
she O
was O
admitted O
for O
fever B-problem
and O
neutropenia B-problem
and O
at O
that O
time O
had O
a B-problem
UTI I-problem
with O
blood B-problem
clots I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
urine I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
presents O
today O
with O
complaints O
of O
fever B-problem
and O
a B-test
temperature I-test
of O
100 O
. O

She O
has O
also O
been O

In O
summary O
, O
the O
patient O
is O
a O
49 O
year O
old O
woman O
with O
metastatic B-problem
breast I-problem
cell I-problem
CA I-problem
, O
status O
post O
chemotherapy B-treatment
with O
CMSAP B-treatment
and O
PVSC B-treatment
and O
XRT B-treatment
who O
presented O
with O
fever B-problem
, O
four O
days O
of O
diarrhea B-problem
, O
nausea B-problem
and O
vomiting B-problem
and O
had O
been O
on O
Keflex B-treatment
for O
an B-problem
erythema I-problem
on I-problem
her I-problem
left I-problem
chest I-problem
wall I-problem
. O

The B-treatment
Keflex I-treatment
was O
stopped O
when O
she O
developed O
the B-problem
diarrhea I-problem
. O

When O
she O
arrived O
the O
plan O
was O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
treat O
here O
rythematous O
induration O
and O
possible O
cellulitis B-problem
with O
IV B-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
. O

So O
she O
was O
put O
on O
dicloxicillin B-treatment
and O
we O
did O
local O
wound O
care O
with O
an O
agent O
called O
Santyl O
, O
which O
is O
a B-treatment
collagenace I-treatment
ondebrided I-treatment
which O
worked O
very O
well O
for O
her O
. O

Also O
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission O
we O
were O
also O
considering O
palliative B-treatment
Taxol I-treatment
chemotherapy I-treatment
, O
which O
the O
patient O
declined O
. O

She O
refused O
the B-treatment
Taxol I-treatment
therapy I-treatment
so O
that O
was O
not O
done O
. O

Another O
major O
issue O
with O
this O
patient O
was O
pain B-treatment
control I-treatment
. O

She O
had O
been O
in O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
pain B-problem
from O
her B-problem
left I-problem
arm I-problem
lesion I-problem
. O

So O
pain B-treatment
control I-treatment
was O
a O
big O
issue O
so O
she O
was O
on O
MS B-treatment
Contin I-treatment
and O
MSIR B-treatment
at O
home O
she O
thought O
that O
clouded O
her O
thinking O
, O
so O
we O
tried O
different O
things O
for O
pain B-treatment
management I-treatment
. O

One O
of O
them O
was O
to O
do O
a B-problem
subarachnoid I-problem
neurologic I-problem
block I-problem
at I-problem
C6-C7 I-problem
interface I-problem
on O
1-6-94 O
. O

After O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
minimal O
relief O
of O
pain B-problem
. O

However O
, O
she O
declined O
further O
blocks O
, O
which O
were O
offered O
to O
her O
. O

So O
accepted O
to O
be O
on O
dilaudid B-treatment
p.o. I-treatment
which O
was O
started O
at O
a O
dosage O
of O
2-4 O
meg O
but O
since O
then O
we O
have O
tapered O
it O
up O
. O

She O
is O
now O
getting O
dilaudid B-treatment
8 O
mg O
q2h O
and O
in O
addition O
she O
has O
been O
on O
fentanyl B-treatment
patch I-treatment
. O

She O
is O
now O
getting O
75 O
micrograms O
per O
hour O
of O
the B-treatment
fentanyl I-treatment
patch I-treatment
which O
is O
changed O
every O
72 O
hours O
. O

We O
can O
go O
up O
by O
25 O
mg O
on O
the B-treatment
fentanyl I-treatment
patch I-treatment
as O
needed O
to O
control O
her B-problem
pain I-problem
and O
we O
can O
always O
go O
up O
on O
the B-treatment
dilaudid I-treatment
because O
she O
is O
still O
in O
considerable O
amount O
of O
pain B-problem
. O

Other O
things O
that O
happened O
during O
this O
admission O
- O
we O
obtained O
ahead B-test
CT I-test
for O
her O
on O
the O
8th O
of O
January O
because O
of O
her B-problem
clouded I-problem
thinking I-problem
and O
altered B-problem
mental I-problem
status I-problem
, O
which O
was O
probably O
due O
to O
the B-treatment
morphine I-treatment
that O
she O
was O
taking O
. O

We O
went O
ahead O
and O
got O
a B-test
head I-test
CT I-test
scanand I-test
it O
showed O
no O
enhancing B-problem
lesions I-problem
. O

In O
addition O
her O
liver O
transaminases O
were O
elevated B-problem
, O
we O
thought O
about O
doing O
further B-test
work-up I-test
, O
but O
that O
was O
deferred O
because O
the O
patient O
wanted O
to O
wait O
on O
that O
. O

That O
has O
been O
stable O
. O

The O
patient O
on O
January O
13 O
became O
hyponatremic B-problem
. O

Her B-test
sodium I-test
went O
down O
to O
121 O
and O
before O
that O
on O
admission O
she O
was O
133 O
. O

A O
renal O
consult O
was O
obtained O
and O
their B-test
assessment I-test
was O
that O
this O
was O
probably O
a O
mixture O
of O
hypovolemia B-problem
as O
well O
as O
SIADH O
. O

We O
proceeded O
to O
do O
for O
her B-problem
hyponatremia I-problem
- O
we O
gave O
her B-problem
some I-problem
fluid I-problem
and O
her B-test
urine I-test
sodium I-test
became O
higher O
than O
her B-test
serum I-test
sodium I-test
; O
we O
stopped O
it O
. O

We O
had O
given O
her B-treatment
some I-treatment
normal I-treatment
saline I-treatment
and O
then O
we O
proceeded O
to O
just O
do O
fluid B-treatment
restriction I-treatment
. O

In O
addition O
we O
gave O
her O
a B-treatment
sodium I-treatment
chloride I-treatment
one O
gram O
per O
day O
and O
that O
also O
helped O
, O
so O
that O
now O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the B-test
patient I-test
&apos;s I-test
sodium I-test
is O
between O
126 O
and O
129 O
; O
prior O
to O
that O
it O
had O
gone O
down O
to O
as O
low O
116. O

So O
that O
has O
really O
improved O
. O

We O
suggest O
continuing B-problem
increased I-problem
salt I-problem
intake I-problem
in O
her O
diet O
and O
also O
continuing O
with O
the B-treatment
fluid I-treatment
restriction I-treatment
of O
free O
water O
intake O
to O
one O
liter O
per O
day O
. O

On O
the O
14th O
of O
January O
, O
the O
patient O
developed O
increased B-problem
shortness I-problem
of I-problem
breath I-problem
and O
chest B-test
x-ray I-test
was O
taken O
showed O
a B-problem
wedge I-problem
shaped I-problem
infiltrate I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
right I-problem
upper I-problem
lobe I-problem
which O
was O
consistent O
with O
Hampton B-problem
&apos;s I-problem
hump I-problem
. O

Also O
a B-test
VQ I-test
scan I-test
obtained O
the O
next O
day O
showed O
high B-problem
probability I-problem
for O
PE B-problem
. O

So O
we O
proceeded O
to O
put O
her O
on O
heparin B-treatment
for O
anticoagulation B-treatment
and O
then O
when O
she O
was O
therapeutic O
on O
heparin B-treatment
, O
we O
went O
ahead O
and O
started O
her O
on O
coumadin B-treatment
and O
she O
is O
currently O
on O
coumadin B-treatment
at O
2.5 O
mg O
q.h.s. O

Her B-test
INR I-test
is O
2.3 O
. O

We O
want O
her B-test
INR I-test
to O
remain O
between O
2 O
and O
3 O
. O

So O
if O
it O
goes O
much O
lower O
than O
2 O
, O
then O
we O
would O
consider O
increasing O
it O
to O
perhaps O
coumadin B-treatment
2.5 O
and O
5 O
alternating O
every O
other O
night O
. O

However O
, O
we O
would O
leave O
it O
at O
2.5 O
for O
now O
. O

Other O
major O
issues O
- O
As O
a O
result O
of O
all O
the O
things O
happened O
and O
with O
her B-problem
hyponatremia I-problem
and O
also O
the B-problem
other I-problem
problems I-problem
, O
her B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
was O
elevated B-problem
also O
. O

We O
put O
her O
on O
nifedipine B-treatment
IR I-treatment
, O
SL B-treatment
and O
that O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
control O
her B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
which O
was O
in O
the O
200s O
in O
the O
systolic O
, O
so O
we O
had O
started O
her O
on O
atenolol B-treatment
. O

So O
on O
discharge O
she O
is O
on O
atenolol B-treatment
100 O
. O

If O
needed O
to O
you O
can O
give O
her B-treatment
some I-treatment
nifedipine I-treatment
SL I-treatment
to O
decrease O
her B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
. O

The O
patient O
also O
has O
significant B-problem
edema I-problem
in I-problem
both I-problem
arms I-problem
now O
and O
also O
some B-problem
mild I-problem
edema I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
lower I-problem
extremities I-problem
, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
fluid B-treatment
restriction I-treatment
should O
help O
with O
that O
. O

She O
is O
also O
a O
little O
dry O
. O

The O
patient O
is O
on O
oxygen B-treatment

On O
initial B-test
exam I-test
the O
patient O
was O
not O

, O
seemed O
somewhat B-problem
slow I-problem
, O
and O
had O
difficulties O
generating O
a O

. O

His O
cranial O
nerves O

were O
full O
, O
and O
the B-test

both I-problem

suggesting B-problem
peripheral I-problem

A B-test

performed O
in O
the O
Deanna O
that O

R-frontal I-problem
intraparenchymal I-problem

in O
the O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
by O
both O
neurology O

neurosurgery O
, O
and O
the O
two O
teams O
agreed O
that O
the O

The O
location O

was O
not O
felt O

be O
typical O
for O
hypertensive B-problem
bleed I-problem

and O
it O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
unlikely O
that O
the B-problem

to O
the B-problem
bleed I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
could O
not O
undergo O
an B-test

his B-treatment

. O

She O
tolerated O
this B-treatment
procedure I-treatment
without O
complications B-problem
initially O
and O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
Recovery O
Room O
in O
stable O
condition O
. O

Postoperatively O
, O
she O
had O
her B-treatment
heparin I-treatment

and O
had O
a B-test
PTT I-test
rising O
to O
142.8 O
and O
then O
down O

clots I-problem
and O
blood O

on O
postoperative O
day O
# O

and O
in O
the O
two O
days O
subsequent O
to O
the B-test
transfusion I-test
, O
returned O
to O

. O

Otherwise O
, O
her O
postoperative O
course O

uneventful O
with O
gradual O
resolution O
of O
the O
passage O
of O
blood O
per O
rectum O
. O

Her B-treatment
heparin I-treatment

At O
this O
time O

which O
was O
treated O
with O
Vancomycin B-treatment
, O
dosed O
to O

11-Coma O
. O

The O
patient O
, O
although O
initially O
minimally O

A B-test
CT I-test
scan I-test
on I-test
admission I-test
revealed O
no O
evidence O
of O

though O
he O
did O
have O
sphenoid B-problem

the O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
hypotensive B-problem
. O

Mid-way O
through O
his O
hospital O
course O
he O
developed O
trilobar B-problem
pneumonia I-problem

this O
was O
probably O
complicated O

, O
intraoperative B-test
transesophageal I-test
echocardiogram I-test
evaluation I-test
showed O
only O
mild B-problem
mitral I-problem
regurgitation I-problem
, O
so O
no O

was O
indicated O
. O

Following O
the B-treatment
operation I-treatment
, O
she O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
CSRU O
. O

On O
postoperative O
day O
one O
, O
she O

noted O
to O
be O
largely O
unresponsive B-problem
with O
left B-problem

emboli I-problem
. O

These O
were O
found O
in O
the O
right O
cerebellar O
, O
occipital O
and O
anterior O
parietal O
lobes O
. O

The O
neurology O
service O
was O
consulted O
and O
attributed O
these O
findings O
to O
cholesterol B-problem
emboli I-problem
. O

Due O
to O
seizure B-problem
activity I-problem
, O
Dilantin B-treatment
was O
started O
. O

Anticoagulation B-treatment
was O
not O
recommended O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
several O
days O
, O
her O
neurological O
status O
slowly O
improved O
. O

She O
was O
eventually O
extubated O
without O

day O
six O
. O

She O
remained O
mostly O
in O
a O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
and O
transitioned O
to O
oral B-treatment
Amiodarone I-treatment
which O
will O
need O
to O
continue O
for O
three O
months O
postop O
. O

She O
tolerated O
beta B-treatment
blockade I-treatment
which O
was O
slowly O
advanced O
as O
tolerated O
. O

She O
worked O
daily O
with O
physical B-test
and O
occupational O
therapy O
. O

Her B-problem
neurological I-problem
status I-problem
continued O
to O
improve O
. O

Acyclovir B-treatment
was O
eventually O
increased O
from O
her O
maintenance O
dose O
for O
a B-problem
herpes I-problem
zoster I-problem
breakout I-problem
on I-problem
her I-problem
right I-problem
upper I-problem
back I-problem
. O

In O
addition O
, O
she O
was O
empirically O
started O
on O
Flagyl B-treatment
for O
persistent B-problem
diarrhea I-problem
( O
despite O
negative O
C. B-test
diff I-test
cultures I-test

, O
however O
she O
developed O
an B-problem
additional I-problem
rash I-problem
on I-problem
her I-problem
buttocks I-problem
after O
the O
first O
dose O
of O
flagyl B-treatment
, O
so O
the B-treatment
flagyl I-treatment
was O
discontinued O
. O

She O
developed O
a B-problem
urinary I-problem
tract I-problem
infection I-problem
for O
which O
she O
was O
started O
on O
Bactrim B-treatment
. O

A B-treatment
foley I-treatment
catheter I-treatment
was O
inserted O
given O
her B-problem
mutiple I-problem
episodes I-problem
of I-problem
incontinence I-problem
that O
were O
adding O
to O
skin B-problem
irritation I-problem
. O

On O
insertion O
she O
was O
found O
to O
be O
retaining O
1400 O
cc O
of O
urine O
, O
so O
the B-treatment
foley I-treatment
catheter I-treatment

clinical O
improvements O
and O

pressure I-test
. O

Notably O
, O
intracranial B-test
pressure I-test
was O
17 O
when O
the O
bolt O
was O
placed O
. O

During O
his O
hospitalization O
, O
his B-test
intracranial I-test
pressure I-test
was O
monitored O
very O
closely O
and O
maintained O
to O
a O
level O
of O
less O
than O
20 O
. O

To O
do O
this O
, O
mannitol B-treatment
25 O
mg O
q. O
6h. O
was O
used O
. O

While O
using O
mannitol B-treatment
, O
his B-test
serum I-test
osmolalities I-test
were O
followed O
closely O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
to O
monitoring O
his B-test
intracranial I-test
pressure I-test
, O
his B-test
systemic I-test
blood I-test
pressures I-test
were O
maintained O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
that O
his B-test
cerebral I-test
perfusion I-test
pressure I-test
was O
maintained O
at O
70 O
mmHg O
. O

A B-test

for O
his B-problem
neurologic I-problem
status I-problem
PaCO2 I-problem
which O
was O
maintained O
between O
35 O
and O
40 O
during O
his B-treatment
hospitalization I-treatment
. O

Mr. O
Roach O
was O
kept O
sedated B-treatment
with O
propofol B-treatment
and O
was O
given O
Fentanyl B-treatment
and O
/ O
or O
morphine B-treatment
boluses I-treatment
for O
pain B-problem
. O

Neurologic B-test
checks I-test
were O
followed O
initially O
every O
one O
hour O
and O
then O
every O
two O
hours O
to O
monitor O
for O
change O
in O
neurologic B-test
examination I-test
. O

During O
his B-treatment
hospitalization I-treatment
, O
two B-test
subsequent I-test
CAT I-test
scans I-test
were O
obtained O
; O
one O
on O
hospital O
day O
two O
. O

This B-test
CAT I-test
scan I-test
revealed O
possible O
worsening B-problem
and O
was O
read O
as O
epidural B-problem
versus I-problem
subdural I-problem
bleed I-problem
. O

After O
a O
discussion O
with O
both O
Radiology O
and O
Neurosurgery O
, O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
that O
the O
worsening O
did O
not O
appear O
significant O
, O
and O
this O
was O
not O
accompanied O
by O
a B-problem
change I-problem
in I-problem
his I-problem
clinical I-problem
condition I-problem
. O

His B-test
intracranial I-test
pressure I-test
remained O
stable O
, O
and O
his B-test
clinical I-test
examination I-test
was O
unchanged O
. O

An B-test
additional I-test
CT I-test
scan I-test
was O
obtained O
on O
hospital O
day O
three O
. O

This B-test
examination I-test
was O
unchanged O
from O
the B-test
previous I-test
examination I-test
. O

Again O
, O
his B-test
intracranial I-test
pressure I-test
and O
neurologic B-test
examination I-test
remained O
the O
same O
, O
and O
conservative B-treatment
treatment I-treatment
was O
opted O
for O
. O

2. O
CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

As O
described O
in O
previous O
section O
, O
Neo-Synephrine B-treatment

70 O
. O

A B-treatment
pulmonary I-treatment
artery I-treatment
catheter I-treatment
was O
placed O
on O
hospital O
day O
four O
. O

This B-treatment
catheter I-treatment
was O
placed O
when O
the O

shot O
on O
hospital O
day O
three O
, O
a O

. O

Gastroenterology O
was O
consulted O
for O
this O
. O

Gastroenterology O
was O
consulted O

for O
more O
details O
. O

Mr. O
Knueppel O
had O
a O
long O
postoperative O
course O
. O

His O
postoperative O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
hypertension B-problem
which O
was O
managed O
medically O
. O

During O
his O
postoperative O
course O
, O
he O
did O
not O
suffer O
from O
any B-problem
arrhythmias I-problem
nor O
did O
he O
have O
any O
episode O
of O
hypotension B-problem
. O

At O
the O
time O

, O
he O
was O
on O
a B-treatment
stable I-treatment
antihypertensive I-treatment
regimen I-treatment
appropriate O
for O
someone O
with O
a B-problem
decreased I-problem
ejection I-problem

. O

Mr. O
Knueppel O
had O
had O
a O
long O
protracted O
period O
of O
intubation B-treatment
prior O
to O
the B-treatment
operation I-treatment
. O

The O
status O
of O
Mr. O
Nina O
pulmonary O
system O
necessitated O
a B-treatment
prolonged I-treatment
postoperative I-treatment
intubation I-treatment
. O

After O
a B-problem
very I-problem
slow I-problem
wean I-problem
from O
ventilatory B-treatment
support I-treatment
, O
Mr. O
Knueppel O
was O
successfully O
extubated O
on O
postoperative O
day O
number O
nine O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
be O
very B-problem
tenuous I-problem
from O
a O
pulmonary O
point O
of O
view O
and O
required O
frequent B-treatment
chest I-treatment
PT I-treatment
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Mr. O
Knueppel O
was O
kept O
in O
the O

. O

There O
is O
much B-problem
scarring I-problem
surrounding I-problem
his I-problem
larynx I-problem
. O

Such O
a O
situation O
frequently O
makes O
it O
very O
difficult O
to O
swallow O
without O
aspirating O
. O

As O
is O
expected O
, O
Mr. O
Knueppel O
failed O

study I-test
early O
on O
in O
his O
Boston O
Regional O
Medical O

hospital O
course O
. O

The B-test
study I-test
was O
repeated O
and O
yet O
again O
Mr. O
Knueppel O
was O
unable O
to O
swallow O
without O
evidence O
of O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Cardiac O
Catheterization O
Laboratory O
. O

There O
, O
her B-test
pulmonary I-test
wedge I-test
pressure I-test
was O
12 O
and O
her B-test
right I-test
atrial I-test
pressure I-test
was O
4 O
and O
pulmonary B-test
artery I-test
pressure I-test
44/17 O
. O

Her B-test
left I-test
ventricular I-test
contraction I-test
showed O
akinesis B-problem
of I-problem
the I-problem
anterior I-problem
wall I-problem
with O
dyskinesis B-problem
of I-problem
the I-problem
apex I-problem
. O

She O
had O
preserved O
inferior B-problem
contraction I-problem
and O
basal B-problem
contraction I-problem
. O

Her O
native O
right O
and O
left O
anterior O
descending O
vessels O
were O
occluded B-problem
as O
was O
an O
obtuse O
marginal O
branch O
. O

The O
saphenous O
vein O
to O
the O
high O
diagonal O
or O
high O
obtuse O
marginal O
was O
occluded B-problem
. O

The O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
to O
the O
left O
anterior O
descending O
was O
also O
occluded B-problem
. O

The B-treatment
saphenous I-treatment
vein I-treatment
graft I-treatment
to O
the O
second O
obtuse O
marginal O
was O
open O
with O
no O
significant B-problem
stenosis I-problem
, O
but O
there O
was O
an B-problem
outflow I-problem
lesion I-problem
in O
the O
obtuse O
marginal O
2 O
as O
well O
as O
severe B-problem
distal I-problem
lesion I-problem
as O
the O
obtuse O
marginal O
2 O
fed O
the O
posterior O
descending O
artery O
. O

This O
was O
considered O
her B-problem
culprit I-problem
lesion I-problem
. O

This O
was O
considered O
too O
high O
risk O
for O
angioplasty B-treatment
because O
of O
the B-problem
severe I-problem
disease I-problem
in O
the B-treatment
graft I-treatment
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
she O
had O
saphenous B-treatment
vein I-treatment
harvested O
from O
both O
thighs O
. O

Her O
left O
internal O
mammary O
artery O
was O
also O
unused O
. O

It O
was O
also O
noted O
that O
she O
had O
failure B-problem
to I-problem
sense I-problem
with O
the B-problem
atrial I-problem
lead I-problem
. O

She O
would O
not O
sense O
the B-problem
atrial I-problem
contraction I-problem
and O
the O
fire O
and O
this O
occasionally O
led O
to O
competition O
of O
firing O
. O

This O
was O
intermittent O
. O

The B-test
P I-test
wave I-test
amplitude I-test
was O
.6 O
and O
this O
could O
not O
be O
totally O
sensed O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
management B-treatment
of O
her B-problem
coronary I-problem
artery I-problem
disease I-problem
and O
evaluation B-test
of O
her B-treatment
pacemaker I-treatment
. O

It O
was O
noted O
that O
she O
became O
very B-problem
symptomatic I-problem
when O
she O
was O
not O
on O
a B-treatment
beta I-treatment
blocker I-treatment
but O
that O
on O
a B-treatment
beta I-treatment
blocker I-treatment
she O
had O
significant B-problem
pacemaker I-problem
failure I-problem
. O

Her B-treatment
pacemaker I-treatment
was O
set O
to O
a B-test
VVI I-test
mode I-test
which O
sensed O
appropriately O
. O

She O
was O
in O
sinus O
rhythm O
with O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O

When O
her B-treatment
pacemaker I-treatment
was O
in O
a O
sinus O
rhythm O
without O
a B-treatment
beta I-treatment
blocker I-treatment
, O
she O
had O
significant B-problem
angina I-problem
. O

Carotid B-test
non-invasive I-test
testing I-test
was O
unremarkable O
. O

The O
situation O
was O
reviewed O
with O
Dr. O
Niste O
Graft O
. O

He O
felt O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
a B-treatment
coronary I-treatment
artery I-treatment
bypass I-treatment
graft I-treatment
candidate O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
conduit B-problem
and O
because O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
a B-problem
large I-problem
anterior I-problem
myocardial I-problem
infarction I-problem
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
maximize O
her B-treatment
beta I-treatment
blockers I-treatment
and O
nitrates B-treatment
. O

The O
situation O
was O
reviewed O
with O
Dr. O
No O
of O
the O
Pacemaker O
Service O
. O

On O
August O
20 O
, O
under O
local B-treatment
anesthesia I-treatment
the I-treatment
right I-treatment
pectoral I-treatment
region I-treatment
was O
explored O
and O
the O
leads O
disconnected O
and O
the O
pulse O
generator O
changed O
to O
a O
CPI O
unit O
in O
which O
the B-test
sensitivity I-test
could O
be O
adjusted O
to O
.15 O
mm. O
, O
which O
permitted O
appropriate O
atrial B-test
sensing I-test
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
prior O
generator O
and O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
leads O
. O

It O
just O
needed O
a O
unit O
that O
could O
have O
more B-problem
sensitivity I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
atrial I-problem
mode I-problem
. O

She O
tolerated O
this O
well O
. O

Her B-treatment
medications I-treatment
were O
resumed O
. O

She O
ambulated O
without O
difficulty B-problem
and O
was O
discharged O
to O
home O
to O
be O
followed O
medically O
for O
her B-problem

Despite O
this O
, O
his B-test
chest I-test

continued O
to O
show O
severe B-problem
pulmonary I-problem
edema I-problem
and O

He O
required O
anti-hypertensive B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
initially O
with O

. O

Very O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
on O
postoperative O
day O
# O
3 O
, O
the O
patient O
became O
acutely B-problem
hypoxic I-problem
after O
several O
hours O
of O
marginal B-problem
oxygenation I-problem
with O
respiratory B-problem
rates I-problem
in O
the O
thirties O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
urgently O
intubated B-treatment
, O
without O
complication B-problem
. O

With O
positive B-treatment
pressure I-treatment
ventilation I-treatment
and O
continued O
diuresis B-treatment
, O
his B-test
arterial I-test

improved O
. O

Throughout O
this O
he O
remained O
hemodynamically O
stable O
. O

Exception O
was O
a O
ten O
beat O
run O
of O
ventricular B-problem
tachycardia I-problem
which O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
ischemic B-problem
in I-problem
origin I-problem
and O
treated O
with O
nitrates B-treatment
and O
Lidocaine B-treatment
. O

His B-test
chest I-test
x-ray I-test
blossomed O
to O
demonstrate O
pulmonary B-problem

and O
the O
patient O
began O
to O
produce O

. O

Infectious B-test
Disease I-test
consultation I-test
was O
obtained O
for O
evaluation B-test
of O
his B-problem

evaluation I-test
commented O
on O
the B-problem
patient I-problem
&apos;s I-problem
increasing I-problem
ventricular I-problem
ectopy I-problem
and O
suggested O
that O
these O
were O
due O
to O
an B-problem
R I-problem
and I-problem
T I-problem
phenomenon I-problem
from O
his B-treatment
pacer I-treatment
in O
the O
setting O
of O
prolonged B-problem
QT I-problem
interval I-problem
. O

Consequently O
his B-treatment
Pronestyl I-treatment
was O
discontinued O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
given O
magnesium B-treatment
to O
bring O
his O

. O

On O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
18th O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
remain O
hemodynamically O
stable O
, O
although O
his B-test
oxygenation I-test
was O
clearly O
deteriorating O
and O
more O
marginal O
. O

On O
60% O
FIO2 O
his B-test
pO2 I-test
was O
63 O

Within O
one O
minute O
, O
the O
patient O
lost O
his B-test
blood I-test

and O
CPR B-treatment
was O
initiated O
and O

The O
patient O
initially O
continued O
to O

he O
was O
bolused O
with O
Levophed B-problem
and O
given O

obtained O
. O

The O
chest O
was O
opened O
partially O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
rhythm O
degenerated O
to O
ventricular B-problem
tachycardia I-problem
and O
he O
was O
shocked O

the B-problem
patient I-problem
&apos;s I-problem
gunshot I-problem

was O
sutured O
close O
in O
the O

The O

precautions I-treatment
, O
and O
was O
hydrated B-treatment
with O
an B-treatment
infusion I-treatment
of I-treatment
intravenous I-treatment

. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Psychiatry O
Service O
, O
who O
began O
a O
battery O
of O
testing B-test
, O
which O
continues O
at O
the O
time O
of O

. O

The O
Consulting O
Psychiatrist O
recommended O
a O
minimum O
of O
2 B-treatment

at O
all O
times O
, O
and O
recommended O
the O
patient O
be O
monitored O
by O
a O

. O

Allowing O
the O
patient O
to O
ambulate O
was O
not O
recommended O
. O

From O
a O
medical O
standpoint O
, O
the O
patient O
did O
well O
. O

He O
was O
initially O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neurological O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
where O
he O
was O
closely O
monitored O
during O
the O
first O
two O
days O
of O
his B-treatment
hospitalization I-treatment
. O

The O
chief O
obstacle O
was O
bringing O
his B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
under O
control O
and O
this O
was O
ultimately O
achieved O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
Captopril B-treatment
and O
Nifedipine B-treatment
. O

After O
his B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
had O
stabilized O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Neurology O
Ward O
. O

Close B-test
monitoring I-test
demonstrated O
his B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
to O
be O
stable O
and O
within O
an O
acceptable O
rang O
on O
his B-treatment
dosage I-treatment
regimen I-treatment
. O

The O
Psychiatry O
Service O
followed O
up O
extensively O
with O
the O
patient O
, O
and O
his O
Psychiatric O
progress O
is O
detailed O
in O
the O
Psychiatry O
transfer O

By O
the O
7th O

day O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
medically O
stable O

He O
had O
undergone B-test
full I-test
Psychiatric I-test
evaluation I-test
, O
and O
was O
prepared O
for O
transfer O
to O
a O

. O

Therefore O
, O
because O
of O
his O
need O
for O

not O
kept O
any O

The O
importance O
of O
quitting O
smoking O
as O
well O
as O
continuing O
to O
follow O
his B-treatment
medical I-treatment
regimen I-treatment
was O
emphasized O
to O
the O
daughter O

She O
will O
be O
actively O
involved O
in O
encouraging O
the O

this B-treatment
medical I-treatment
regimen I-treatment
and O
also O
to O
follow O

as O
Dr. O
Lfsquarc O
on O
the O

The O
patient O
remained O
guaiac O

the O
entire O
hospitalization O

Despite O
being O
on O
heparin B-treatment
for O
a O
short O

remained O
very O
stable O
with O
only O
a B-problem
small I-problem

after O
the B-test

was O
done O
. O

He O
will O
need O
to O
be O
followed O
up O
as O
an O
out O

CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
complaints O
of O
dyspnea B-problem
on O
exertion O
and O
chest B-test
pressure I-test
which O
could O
be O
consistent O
with O
angina B-problem
. O

However O
, O
given O
the O
long O
duration O
of O
the B-problem
symptoms I-problem
and O
negative O
workup B-test
in O
the O
past O
, O
it O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
unlikely O
. O

However O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
an B-treatment
aspirin I-treatment
as O
well O
as O
a B-treatment
beta I-treatment
blocker I-treatment
, O
and O
a O
rule O
out O
myocardial B-treatment
infarction I-treatment
protocol I-treatment
was O
initiated O
. O

A B-problem
stress I-problem
thallium I-problem
was O
planned O
for O
the O
day O
following O
admission O
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
night O
of O
admission O
the O
patient O
was O
found O
lying O
in O
her O
bed O
diaphoretic O
and O
obtunded O
, O
and O
a O
code O
was O
called O
. O

Further B-test
examination I-test
revealed O
a O
strong O
palpable O
pulse O
with O
a B-test
systolic I-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
in O
the O
130 O
s O
and O
a B-test
heart I-test
rate I-test
in O
the O
80 O
s. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
few O
minutes O
the O
patient O
became O
increasingly O
more O
responsive O
. O

She O
was O
treated O
with O
a B-treatment
fluid I-treatment
bolus I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
quickly O
responded O
to O
a B-treatment
fluid I-treatment
bolus I-treatment
and O
became O
interactive O
. O

She O
reported O
that O
she O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
commode O
urinating O
and O
began O
to O
feel O
nauseous B-problem
and O
presyncopal B-problem
. O

She O
was O
able O
to O
get O
to O
bed O
at O
which O
point O
she O
passed O
out O
. O

She O
denied O
any B-problem
chest I-problem
pain I-problem
or O
pressure B-problem
, O
and O
no O
shortness B-problem
of I-problem
breath I-problem
during O
this O
event O
. O

A B-test
rhythm I-test
check I-test
obtained O
during O
the O
time O
of O
this O
event O
demonstrated O
a O
pause O
of O
six O
seconds O
followed O
by O
a O
junctional O
escape O
rhythm O
. O

An B-test
electrocardiogram I-test
obtained O
after O
the O
code O
demonstrated O
no O
acute B-problem
changes I-problem
. O

Her B-problem
acute I-problem
bradycardic I-problem
event I-problem
was O
felt O
likely O
secondary O
to O
her B-treatment
new I-treatment
beta I-treatment
blocker I-treatment
in O
conjunction O
with O
a B-problem
vagal I-problem
response I-problem
. O

It O
was O
determined O
to O
stop O
the B-treatment
beta I-treatment
blocker I-treatment
, O
and O
atropine B-treatment
was O
placed O
at O
the O
bedside O
. O

On O
the O
following O
day O
the O
patient O
underwent O
an B-test
echocardiogram I-test
which O
demonstrated O
dilated B-problem
right I-problem
ventricle I-problem
secondary O
to O
chronic B-problem
dysfunction I-problem
and O
a B-test
pulmonary I-test
artery I-test
pressure I-test
of O
greater O
than O
100 O
. O

Her B-test
stress I-test
test I-test
was O
cancelled O
. O

A B-test
CT I-test
angiogram I-test
was O
ordered O
to O
evaluate O
for O
chronic B-problem
thromboembolic I-problem
disease I-problem
as O
a O
potential O
cause O
of O
her B-problem
pulmonary I-problem
hypertension I-problem
. O

She O
was O
ruled O
out O
for O
myocardial B-problem
infarction I-problem
with O
three O
sets O
of O
normal B-test
enzymes I-test
and O
continued O
to O
be O
monitored O
on O
telemetry B-test
. O

A B-test
Pulmonary I-test
consultation I-test
was O
obtained O
to O
evaluate O
for O
possible O
etiology O
of O
the B-problem
patient I-problem
's I-problem
hypotension I-problem
. O

There O
was O
little O
evidence O
to O
suggest O
any B-problem
cardiac I-problem
disease I-problem
, O
and O
given O
the B-problem
patient I-problem
's I-problem
Grave's I-problem
disease I-problem
an I-problem
autoimmune I-problem
process I-problem
was O
felt O
to O
be O
possible O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
consideration O
was O
given O
to O
sarcoidosis B-problem
, O
human B-problem
immunodeficiency I-problem
virus I-problem
, O
and O
drug-induced B-problem
given O
her O
history O
of O
herbal B-treatment
medication I-treatment
use O
. O

It O
was O
recommended O
that O
the O
patient O
begin O
anticoagulation B-treatment
given O
the O
severity O
of O
her B-problem
pulmonary I-problem
hypertension I-problem
. O

It O
was O
also O
planned O
to O
undergo O
a B-test
right I-test
heart I-test
catheterization I-test
with O
a B-problem
vasodilation I-problem
trial O
by O
the O
catheterization O
laboratory O
. O

A B-test
right I-test
heart I-test
catheterization I-test
was O
performed O
on O
2014-12-05 O
. O

A B-treatment
pharmacologic I-treatment
pulmonary I-treatment
vasodilator I-treatment
challenge I-treatment
was O
performed O
with O
a B-problem
positive I-problem
response I-problem
. O

In O
addition O
, O
a B-test
CT I-test
angiogram I-test
of I-test
the I-test
chest I-test
with O
pulmonary B-test
embolism I-test
protocol I-test
showed O
no O
intravascular B-problem
filling I-problem
defect I-problem
but O
did O
show O
a B-problem
right I-problem
upper I-problem
lobe I-problem
ground-glass I-problem
and O
scattered B-problem
adenopathy I-problem
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
the B-problem
end I-problem
left I-problem
atrial I-problem

was O
essentially O
ruled O
out O
as O
a B-problem
primary I-problem
cause I-problem
. O

Chronic B-problem
pulmonary I-problem
embolus I-problem
was O
less O
likely O
given O
her O
negative O
CT B-test
angiogram I-test
. O

Chronic B-problem
lung I-problem
disease I-problem
was O
unlikely O
given O
the O
patient O
's O
normal O
pulmonary B-test
function I-test
tests I-test
and O
DLCO B-test
in O
2012 O
as O
well O
as O
a B-test
normal I-test
CT I-test

. O

Collagen B-problem
vascular I-problem
disease I-problem
could O
not O
be O
definitively O
ruled O
out O
; O
however O
, O
given O
the O
patient O
's O
lack O
of O
connective B-problem
tissue I-problem
disorder I-problem
stigmata I-problem
it O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
less O
likely O
, O
and O
the B-test
patient I-test
's I-test
human I-test
immunodeficiency I-test
virus I-test
test I-test
was O
negative O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
most O
likely O
experiencing O
a B-problem
primary I-problem
pulmonary I-problem
hypertension I-problem
. O

Consideration O
was O
given O
to O
treating O
the O
patient O
with O
a O
course O
of O
calcium B-treatment
channel I-treatment
blocker I-treatment
; O
however O
, O
given O
the O
patient O
's O
poor O
response O
to O
Lopressor B-treatment
, O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
this O
would O
not O
be O
optimal B-treatment
treatment I-treatment
for O
the B-problem
patient I-problem
's I-problem
pulmonary I-problem
hypertension I-problem
. O

Therefore O
, O
her O
insurance O
company O
was O
contacted O
regarding O
the O
potential O
of O
Flolan B-treatment
as O
a B-treatment
treatment I-treatment
. O

Plans O
were O
made O
for O
placement O
of O
a B-treatment
Hickman I-treatment
catheter I-treatment
and O
initiation B-treatment
of I-treatment
Flolan I-treatment
treatment I-treatment
. O

However O
, O
on O
12-07 O
, O
the O
patient O
once O
again O
experienced O
an O
episode O
of O
unresponsiveness B-problem
. O

Upon O
arrival O
by O
the O
physician O
the O
patient O
was O
awake O
, O
alert O
, O
and O
oriented O
with O
a B-test
pulse I-test
in O
the O
80 O
s, O
with O
pressure B-test
in O
the O
80 O
s, O
and O
satting B-test
100% O
on O
room O
air O
. O

She O
described O
this B-problem
episode I-problem
as O
an B-problem
uncomfortable I-problem
feeling I-problem
in I-problem
her I-problem
chest I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
2 O
liters O
of O
intravenous B-treatment
fluids I-treatment
with O
a B-problem
bump I-problem
in O
her B-test
systolic I-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
to O
the O
90 O
s. O

Review O
of O
telemetry B-test
revealed O
an O
8 O
to O
9 O
beat O
episode O
of O
nonsustained B-problem
ventricular I-problem
tachycardia I-problem
followed O
by O
an O
episode O
of O
bradycardia B-problem
to O
60 O
beats O
per O
minute O
. O

The O
etiology O
of O
these B-problem
cardiovascular I-problem
episodes I-problem
was O
unclear O
, O
but O
was O
felt O
likely O
secondary O
to O
the B-problem
patient I-problem
's I-problem
tenuous I-problem
cardiovascular I-problem
status I-problem
given O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
had O
clear B-problem
pulmonary I-problem
hypertension I-problem
, O
was O
very B-problem
preload I-problem
dependent I-problem
, O
and O
had O
an O
intact O
left O
ventricular O
function O
but O
with O
cardiac B-test
output I-test
limited O
due O
to O
left B-problem
ventricular I-problem
compression I-problem
by O
a B-problem
dilated I-problem
left I-problem
ventricle I-problem
. O

Given O
the B-problem
patient I-problem
's I-problem
persistent I-problem
hypotensive I-problem
episodes I-problem
, O
and O
decreased B-problem
urine I-problem
output I-problem
, O
she O
was O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
for O
management B-treatment
prior O
to O
initiation B-treatment
of I-treatment
Flolan I-treatment
therapy I-treatment
. O

On O
12-08 O
, O
the B-treatment
Hickman I-treatment
catheter I-treatment
was O
placed O
in O
preparation O
of O
Flolan B-treatment
administration I-treatment
. O

During O
the O
Mass. O
Mental O
Health O
Center O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
exquisitely B-problem
preload I-problem
dependent I-problem
and O
responded O
well O
to O
aggressive B-treatment
fluids I-treatment
as O
needed O
to O
maintain O
her B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
with O
a B-test
systolic I-test
of O
greater O
than O
90 O
. O

She O
had O
no O
further O
episodes O
of O
bradycardia B-problem
during O
her O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-test
patient I-test
's I-test
urine I-test
output I-test
improved O
dramatically O
with O
hydration B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
, O
suggesting O
her B-problem
low I-problem
urine I-problem
output I-problem
was O
secondary O
to O
decreased B-problem
cardiac I-problem
output I-problem
secondary O
to O
low B-problem
preload I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
continued O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
the O
Electrophysiology O
Service O
, O
who O
determined O
that O
the O
patient O
was O
demonstrating O
severe B-problem
vasal I-problem
sensitivity I-problem
with O
bradycardia B-problem
necessitating B-treatment
pacemaker I-treatment
placement I-treatment
. O

This O
was O
to O
be O
deferred O
until O
after O
the O
patient O
had O
her O
Hickman O
in O
place O
. O

Because O
the B-test
patient I-test
's I-test
pulmonary I-test
pressures I-test
responded O
so O
well O
to O
adenosine B-treatment
during O
right B-test
heart I-test
catheterization I-test
, O
it O
was O
thought O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
be O
a O
good O
candidate O
for O
Flolan B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
. O

Flolan B-treatment
was O
initiated O
on O
12-08 O
at O
5 O
nanograms O
per O
kilogram O
per O
minute O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
monitored O
for O
symptoms B-problem
of O
Flolan B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
including O
nausea B-problem
, O
vomiting B-problem
, O
first B-problem
bite I-problem
jaw I-problem
claudication I-problem
, O
or O
hypotension B-problem
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
hospital O
stay O
the B-treatment
patient I-treatment
's I-treatment
Flolan I-treatment
dose I-treatment
was O
titrated O
to O
receive O
maximum O
benefit O
without O
precipitating B-problem
symptoms I-problem
of O
Flolan B-problem
overdose I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
stable O
on O
her B-treatment
current I-treatment
Flolan I-treatment
dose I-treatment
and O
was O
therefore O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

A B-test
high I-test
resolution I-test
CT I-test
was O
requested O
to O
further O
evaluate O
for O
possible O
secondary O
cause O
of O
her B-problem
primary I-problem
pulmonary I-problem
hypertension I-problem
; O
however O
, O
the O
patient O
refused O
it O
at O
this O
time O
. O

Plans O
for O
placement O
of O
a B-treatment
pacemaker I-treatment
were O
initiated O
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
night O
prior O
to O
the O
planned O
surgical O
date O
the O
patient O
suffered O
an O
episode O
of O
bleeding B-problem
from O
her B-treatment
Hickman I-treatment
catheter I-treatment
site I-treatment
. O

Surgery O
was O
notified O
and O
pressure B-test
was O
applied O
; O
however O
, O
it O
did O
not O
stop O
oozing B-problem
. O

A B-treatment
surgicel I-treatment
dressing I-treatment
was O
placed O
and O
prolonged B-test
pressure I-test
resulted O
in O
resolution O
of O
the B-problem
bleeding I-problem
. O

In O
addition O
, O
an B-treatment
extra I-treatment
stitch I-treatment
was O
placed O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
stop O
the B-problem
bleeding I-problem
. O

Following O
this O
episode O
the O
patient O
felt O
like O
she O
was O
" O
too O
stressed O
" O
for O
pacemaker B-treatment
placement I-treatment
. O

Therefore O
, O
she O
was O
monitored O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
for O
any B-problem
further I-problem
bleeding I-problem
events I-problem
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
next O
few O
days O
the O
patient O
became O
more O
accustomed O
to O
her O
Flolan O
, O
and O
Flolan O
teaching O
was O
continued O
. O

She O
continued O
to O
have O
occasional O
episodes O
of O
dizziness B-problem
, O
shortness B-problem
of I-problem
breath I-problem
, O
and O
hypotension B-problem
whenever I-problem
the I-problem
alarm I-problem
sounded O
suggesting O
that O
the B-treatment
Flolan I-treatment
bag I-treatment
needed O
to O
be O
changed O
. O

However O
, O
over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
hospital O
stay O
these O
decreased O
both O
in O
frequency O
and O
severity O
. O

On O
12-15 O
, O
the O
patient O
went O
for O
placement O
of O
a B-treatment
pacemaker I-treatment
. O

She O
had O
dual-mode B-treatment
, O
dual-pacing B-treatment
, O
dual-sensing B-treatment
pacemaker I-treatment
placed O
with O
a B-test
lower I-test
rate I-test
at O
60 O
ppm O
, O
and O
upper B-test
rate I-test
of O
120 O
ppm O
with O
a B-test
paced I-test
AV I-test
of O
150 O
msec O
. O

The O
patient O
recovered O
well O
from O
her B-treatment
surgery I-treatment
for O
pacemaker B-treatment
placement I-treatment
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
tolerating O
her B-treatment
Flolan I-treatment
therapy I-treatment
well O
. O

She O
had O
received O
a O
full O
course O
of O
Flolan O
teaching O
and O
reported O
that O
she O
and O
her O
husband O
felt O
comfortable O
with O
the O
administration O
of O
the B-treatment
medication I-treatment
at O
home O
. O

She O
was O
set O
up O
with O
a B-problem
primary I-problem
pulmonary I-problem
hypertension I-problem
support I-problem
group I-problem
, O
and O
home O
services O
were O
arranged O
to O
help O
her O
in O
the O
initiation O
of O
Flolan B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
. O

Following O
pacemaker B-treatment
placement I-treatment
the O
patient O
had O
no O
further O
episodes O
of O
bradycardia B-problem
on O
telemetry B-test
, O
and O
therefore O
she O
was O
discharged O
in O
satisfactory O
condition O
. O

2. O
INFECTIOUS O
DISEASE O
: O

The O
patient O
had O
no O
signs B-problem
or O
symptoms B-problem
of I-problem
infection I-problem
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission O
. O

However O
, O
she O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
a B-problem
relatively I-problem
elevated I-problem
white I-problem
blood I-problem
cell I-problem
count I-problem
that O
remained O
stable O
over O
the O
course O
of O
her O
hospital O
stay O
. O

However O
, O
near O
the O
end O
of O
her O
hospitalization O
the O
patient O
began O
describing O
increased B-problem
urinary I-problem
frequency I-problem
which O
persisted O
once O
her B-treatment
Foley I-treatment
catheter I-treatment
was O
removed O
. O

A B-test
urinalysis I-test
was O
positive O
and O
urine B-test
culture I-test
grew O
enterococcus B-problem
which O
was O
pan B-test
sensitive I-test
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
started O
on O
levofloxacin B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
to O
complete O
a O
10 O

Following O
initiation O
of O
the B-treatment
antibiotic I-treatment
the B-test
patient I-test
's I-test
white I-test
blood I-test
cell I-test
count I-test
quickly O
came O
down O
, O
and O
she O
remained O
afebrile B-problem
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
still O
had O
a B-problem
mildly I-problem
elevated I-problem
white I-problem
blood I-problem
cell I-problem
count I-problem
but O
was O
asymptomatic B-problem
with O
a O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the B-problem
decreased I-problem
urine I-problem

was O
secondary O
to O
her B-test

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
laboratory O
, O
where O
he O
was O
noted O
initially O
to O
have O
a B-test
pulmonary I-test
wedge I-test
pressure I-test
of O
45 O
with O
a B-test
pulmonary I-test
artery I-test
pressure I-test
of O
82/40 O
. O

This O
lowered O
with O
IV B-treatment
nitroglycerin I-treatment
. O

Selective B-test
coronary I-test
angiography I-test
showed O
an B-problem
occluded I-problem
right I-problem
coronary I-problem
artery I-problem
in I-problem
its I-problem
midportion I-problem
. O

He O
had O
an O
80% O
distal O
left O
main O
, O
a O
90% O
proximal O
circumflex O
, O
and O
multiple B-problem
significant I-problem
lesions I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
LAD I-problem
. O

His B-test
left I-test
ventricle I-test
ejection I-test
showed O
diffuse B-problem
hypokinesis I-problem
. O

The O
situation O
was O
reviewed O
with O
his O
wife O
, O
Sligh O
. O

She O
noted O
that O
he O
was O
actively O
working O
full O
time O
and O
was O
a O
sales O
representative O
at O
the O
Leigh O
and O
lives O
at O
home O
with O
her O
and O
his O
daughter O
, O
age O
18 O
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
, O
because O
of O
the O
evidence O
of O
congestive B-problem
heart I-problem
failure I-problem
and O
the B-problem
critical I-problem
left I-problem
main I-problem
lesion I-problem
, O
he O
should O
be O
admitted O
for O
further B-test
evaluation I-test
. O

Indeed O
, O
he O
was O
treated O
with O
diuretics B-treatment
and O
nitrates B-treatment
along O
with O
cessation B-treatment
of O
his B-treatment
aspirin I-treatment
, O
and O
he O
was O
put O
on O
IV B-treatment
Heparin I-treatment
. O

He O
stabilized O
over O
the O
weekend O
. O

He O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
some B-problem
ventricular I-problem
ectopy I-problem
on O
Holter B-test
monitor I-test
. O

He O
developed O
epigastric B-problem
pain I-problem
on O
07/31 O
which O
previously O
had O
been O
ignored O
but O
in O
retrospect O
was O
probably O
his O
anginal O
equivalent O
. O

He O
also O
had O
multifocal B-problem
ventricular I-problem
ectopy I-problem
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
had O
some B-problem
further I-problem
anterolateral I-problem
ST I-problem
segment I-problem
changes I-problem
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
did O
have O
unstable B-problem
angina I-problem
with O
his B-problem
critical I-problem
coronary I-problem
anatomy I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Electrophysiology O
service O
, O
Dr. O
Slusslashgodle O
, O
who O
said O
that O
he O
had O
no O
indication O
for O
patch B-treatment
placement I-treatment
at O
the O
time O
of O
surgery B-treatment
. O

On O
08/02/93 O
, O
an B-treatment
intra-aortic I-treatment
balloon I-treatment
pump I-treatment
was O
placed O
; O
then O
, O
Dr. O
Thorebreutz O
took O
him O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
, O
where O
he O
had O
quadruple B-treatment
coronary I-treatment
artery I-treatment
bypass I-treatment
grafting I-treatment
. O

He O
had O
a B-treatment
left I-treatment
internal I-treatment
mammary I-treatment
artery I-treatment
graft I-treatment
of I-treatment
the I-treatment
LAD I-treatment
, O
a B-treatment
single I-treatment
saphenous I-treatment
vein I-treatment
to O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery O
with O
280 O
cc O
per O
minute O
flow O
, O
and O
a B-treatment
saphenous I-treatment
vein I-treatment
snake I-treatment
graft I-treatment
to O
the O
diagonal O
and O
circumflex O
with O
150 O
cc O
per O
minute O
flow O
. O

A B-treatment
paraphimosis I-treatment
was O
noted O
and O
treated O
by O
Dr. O
Ryna O
Jescdrig O
. O

After O
surgery B-treatment
he O
had O
a B-problem
ongoing I-problem
sinus I-problem
tachycardia I-problem
. O

He O
was O
able O
to O
be O
rapidly O
weaned O
and O
extubated O
. O

He O
had O
good O
hemodynamics O
. O

He O
had O
occasional B-problem
atrial I-problem
and I-problem
ventricular I-problem
premature I-problem
beats I-problem
. O

His B-treatment
intra-aortic I-treatment
balloon I-treatment
pump I-treatment
was O
weaned O
the O
following O
day O
and O
he O
was O
transferred O
out O
of O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

He O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
the O
Nutrition O
Service O
, O
who O
followed O
him O
for O
dietary B-treatment
management I-treatment
of O
his B-problem
diabetes I-problem
mellitus I-problem
. O

On O
08/05 O
it O
was O
noted O
that O
his B-test
platelet I-test
count I-test
had O
fallen O
from O
171,000 O
to O
54,000 O
; O
this O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
intravenous B-treatment
Heparin I-treatment
and O
indeed O
, O
when O
Heparin B-treatment
was O
discontinued O
, O
since O
it O
had O
been O
restarted O
after O
surgery B-treatment
, O
his B-test
platelet I-test
count I-test
rebounded O
to O
normal O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
does O
have O
a B-problem
thrombocytopenic I-problem
reaction I-problem
to O
Heparin B-treatment
. O

He O
remained O
in O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
. O

He O
did O
have O
runs O
of O
nonsustained B-problem
ventricular I-problem
tachycardia I-problem
, O
which O
were O
clinically O
stable O
. O

He O
had O
a O
right O
bundle O
branch O
block O
. O

He O
is O
at O
increased O
risk O
for O
future O
events O
because O
of O
his B-problem
low I-problem
left I-problem
ventricular I-problem
ejection I-problem
fraction I-problem
, O
but O
he O
is O
clinically O
stable O
on O
ACE B-treatment
inhibitors I-treatment
, O
Digoxin B-treatment
, O
Coumadin B-treatment
, O
and O
aspirin B-treatment
. O

Therefore O
he O
was O
able O
to O
be O
discharged O
home O
. O

He O
understands O
that O
he O
does O
have O
significant B-problem
left I-problem
ventricle I-problem
dysfunction I-problem
and O
requires O
monitoring O
of O
his B-test
prothrombin I-test
times O
and O
his B-problem
arrhythmias I-problem
; O
these O
will O
be O
done O
in O

Present O
Illness O
: O

Ms. O
Swanson O
is O
a O
53 O
yo O
woman O
with O
PMH B-problem
significant O
for O
seizure B-problem
disorder I-problem
, O
brain B-problem
injury I-problem
, O
and O
? O
atypical B-problem
multiple I-problem
sclerosis I-problem
who O
presents O
with O
right B-problem
face I-problem
twitch I-problem
and I-problem
right I-problem
arm I-problem
shaking I-problem
. O

History O
is O
obtained O
from O
her O
sister O
, O
William O
from O
Lawrence O
General O
Hospital O
, O
and O
from O
her O
primary O
neurologist O
, O
Dr. O
Brian O
. O

She O
lives O
in O
an O
assisted O
living O
, O
and O
was O
noted O
yesterday O
to O
have O
generalized B-problem
tonic-clonic I-problem
activity I-problem
beginning O
on O
the O
right O
side O
and O
lasting O
90 O
minutes O
. O

EMS O
gave O
her B-treatment
valium I-treatment
5 O
mg O
pr O
at O
the O
facility O
and O
brought O
her O
to O
Barnstable O
County O
Hospital O
. O

She O
persisted O
with O
right B-problem
sided I-problem
seizure I-problem
activity I-problem
there O
and O
was O
given O
valium B-treatment
10 O
mg O
and O
ativan B-treatment
1 O
mg O
, O
as O
well O
as O
loaded O
with O
dilantin B-treatment
1000 O
mg O
. O

She O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Providence O
Behavioral O
Health O
Hospital O
CMED O
. O

Here O
she O
was O
given O
an B-treatment
additional I-treatment
valium I-treatment
5 O
mg O
x O
2 O
and O
ativan B-treatment
1 O
mg O
x O
3 O
for O
persistent B-problem
twitching I-problem
in I-problem
her I-problem
face I-problem
and I-problem
right I-problem
hand I-problem
. O

Since O
the B-treatment
ativan I-treatment
, O
her B-problem
facial I-problem
twitching I-problem
has O
apparently O
improved O
, O
but O
she O
continues O
to O
have O
hand B-problem
twitches I-problem
. O

She O
also O
had O
an B-test
EEG I-test
, O
which O
showed O
left B-problem
sided I-problem
slowing I-problem
on O
preliminary O
read O
. O

Apparently O
she O
has O
a O
long O
history O
of O
seizure B-problem
disorder I-problem
, O
possibly O
from O
a O
history O
of O
traumatic B-problem
brain I-problem
injury I-problem
( O
though O
per O
Dr. O
Paula O
, O

records O
from O
that O
hospitalization O
indicate O
she O
may O
have O
only O
had O
a B-problem
very I-problem
mild I-problem
injury I-problem
) I-problem
and O
has O
been O
managed O
on O
dilantin B-treatment
and O
keppra B-treatment
. O

Since O
she O
has O
seen O
Dr. O
Ollie O
, O
she O
has O
had O
at O
least O
two O
episodes O
of O
status B-problem
epilepticus I-problem
and O
one B-problem
generalized I-problem
seizure I-problem
, O
as O
well O
as O
some B-problem
less I-problem
significant I-problem
seizures I-problem
which O
are O
characterized O
by O
left O
gaze O
preference O
and O
left B-problem
sided I-problem
tonic-clonic I-problem
activity I-problem
. O

Her B-test
dilantin I-test
levels I-test
had O
been O
somewhat O
difficult O
to O
control O
. O

He O
tried O
adding O
lamictal B-treatment
, O
but O
this O
caused O
a B-problem
rash I-problem
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
her O
last O
visit O
( O
2015-03-18 O
) O
Dr. O
Bradley O
had O
discussed O
the O
addition O
of O
a B-treatment
third I-treatment
Castelluccio I-treatment
, O
possibly O
zonegran B-treatment
( O
less O
likely O
topamax B-treatment
), O
to O
the B-treatment
dilantin I-treatment
200 O
mg O
bid O
and O
keppra B-treatment
1500 O
mg O
bid O
. O

Her O
sister O
had O
wanted O
to O
keep O
the O
current O
course O
because O
she O
felt O
she O
was O
doing O
well O
where O
she O
was O
living O
and O
did O
not O
want O
to O
upset O
that O
. O

However O
, O
she O
had O
several B-test
dilantin I-test
levels I-test
drawn O
since O
her O
last O
visit O
, O
with O
15.4 O
in O
05 O
- O
23.5 O
in O
Theresa O
, O
and O
3.09 O
- O
18 O
. O

Her O
sister O
reports O
that O
the B-treatment
medication I-treatment
dose I-treatment
had O
been O
changed O
to O
200 O
mg O
qam O
and O
100 O
mg O
qpm O
in O
Theresa O
, O
and O
a O
review O
of O
her O
Union O
Hospital O
- O
North O
Shore O
Medical O
Center O
records O
indicates O
that O
this O
may O
have O
occurred O
in O
an O
urgent O
care O
appointment O
secondary O
to O
slurred B-problem
speech I-problem
and O
a B-problem
recent I-problem
fall I-problem
and O
a B-test
non-trough I-test
level I-test
of O
15.9 O
. O

According O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
the O
patient O
has O
no O
short-term O
memory O
. O

She O
has O
been O
living O
in O
an O
assisted O
living O
facility O
and O
frequently O
calls O
her O
even O
right O
after O
she O
has O
left O
without O
remembering O
her O
visit O
. O

The O
patient O
walks O
with O
a B-treatment
walker I-treatment
at O
baseline O
and O
goes O
out O
for O
dinner O
and O
shopping O
with O
her O
sister O
. O

Ms. O
Swanson O
also O
carries O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
" O
atypical B-problem
MS I-problem
", I-problem
which O
she O
brought O
with O
her O
to O
Dr. O
Billie O
. O

According O
to O
Dr. O
Nicole O
, O
she O
has O
had O
stable B-problem
deficits I-problem
for O
many O
years O
without O
any B-problem
flare-like I-problem
episodes I-problem
. O

She O
had O
an B-test
MRI I-test
in O
2014 O
that O
showed O
multiple B-problem
plaque-like I-problem
lesions I-problem
, O
but O
these O
were O
entirely O
stable O
since O
2010 O
. O

She O
is O
not O
undergoing O
any B-treatment

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
a O
53-year-old O
male O
with O
a O
longstanding O
history O
of O
renal B-problem
disease I-problem
with O
multiple B-problem
complications I-problem
and O
problems B-problem
related I-problem
to I-problem
vascular I-problem
access I-problem
and O
hypercoagulable B-problem
state I-problem
. O

These O
culminated O
in O
an B-treatment
attempted I-treatment
cadaveric I-treatment
kidney I-treatment
transplant I-treatment
undertaken O
on O
12/16/97 O
, O
which O
was O
complicated O
by O
thrombosis B-problem
and O
necrosis B-problem
of I-problem
the I-problem
cadaveric I-problem
renal I-problem
vein I-problem
within O
24 O
hours O
. O

This O
required O
a B-treatment
transplant I-treatment
nephrectomy I-treatment
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

The O
patient O
&apos;s O
course O
was O
subsequently O
characterized O
by O
recurrent B-problem
pneumonias I-problem
, O
possibly O
due O
to O
aspiration B-problem
, O
and O
by O
hemodynamic B-problem
instability I-problem
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
from O
the O
Transplant O
Service O
for O
ventilatory B-treatment
management I-treatment
in O
the O
setting O
of O
hypotension B-problem
. O

On O
transfer O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
not O
sedated B-treatment
, O
but O
was O
unresponsive B-problem
and O
extremely B-problem
dyssynchronous I-problem
with O
the B-treatment
ventilator I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
was O
found O
to O
have O
substantial B-problem
auto I-problem
PEEP I-problem
with O
an B-problem
elevated I-problem
dead I-problem
space I-problem
. O

A B-test
pulmonary I-test
arteriogram I-test
on O
01/03/98 O
demonstrated O
multiple B-problem
pulmonary I-problem
emboli I-problem
, O
likely O
less O
than O
one O
week O
old O
, O
possibly O
introduced O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the B-problem
renal I-problem
vein I-problem
thrombosis I-problem
of O
12/19/97 O
. O

An B-treatment
inferior I-treatment
vena I-treatment
cava I-treatment
filter I-treatment
was O
placed O
; O
lower B-test
extremity I-test
noninvasive I-test
studies I-test
were O
negative O
. O

The O
patient O
required O
high B-test
pressures I-test
to O
ventilate O
adequately O
, O
possibly O
related O
to O
an B-problem
abdominal I-problem
compartment I-problem
syndrome I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
had O
undergone B-test
two I-test
abdominal I-test
procedures I-test
following O
explantation B-treatment
. O

The O
physiology O
at O
the O
time O
of O
transfer O
to O
the O
Medical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
was O
consistent O
with O
a B-problem
septic I-problem
process I-problem
. O

CT B-test
scan I-test
demonstrated O
retroperitoneal B-problem
collection I-problem
containing I-problem
both I-problem
free I-problem
air I-problem
and O
extravasated O
contrast O
material O
. O

For O
the O
concern O
of O
a B-problem
perforated I-problem
viscus I-problem
, O
the O
patient O
was O
taken O
to O
exploratory B-test
laparotomy I-test
on O
01/06/98 O
, O
during O
which O
the O
bowel O
was O
run O
without O
evidence O
of O
perforation B-problem
. O

The O
patient O
remained O
unstable B-problem
. O

He O
was O
taken O
to O
fluoroscopy B-test
, O
where O
oral B-test
contrast I-test
was O
demonstrated O
to O
be O
extravasating O
through O
a O
posterior O
duodenum O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
again O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
01/08/98 O
, O
at O
which O
time O
a B-treatment
gastrojejunostomy I-treatment
was O
performed O
with O
stapling B-treatment
across O
the O
gastroduodenal O
junction O
, O
introduction O
of O
five B-treatment
Jackson-Pratt I-treatment
drains I-treatment
into O
the B-problem
retroperitoneal I-problem
mass I-problem
, O
cholecystotomy B-treatment
tube I-treatment
, O
gastrostomy B-treatment
tube I-treatment
, O
and O
jejunostomy B-treatment
tube I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
had O
an B-problem
extensive I-problem
estimated I-problem
blood I-problem
loss I-problem
requiring O
multiple B-treatment
blood I-treatment
products I-treatment
and O
fluid B-treatment
resuscitation I-treatment
therapy I-treatment
. O

Accompanying O
this O
during O
this O
period O
were O
elevations O
in O
liver B-test
function I-test
studies I-test
and O
amylase B-test
and O
lipase B-test
consistent O
with O
pancreatic B-problem
inflammation I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
was O
aggressively O
treated O
with O
fluid B-treatment
resuscitation I-treatment
and O
pressors B-treatment
for O
his B-problem
septic I-problem
physiology I-problem
. O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
cardiac B-problem
tamponade I-problem
or O
specific B-problem
underlying I-problem
coronary I-problem
dysfunction I-problem
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
appropriate B-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
for O
his B-problem
Serratia I-problem
pneumonia I-problem
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
his B-problem
abdominal I-problem
process I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O
have O
an B-problem
underlying I-problem
hypercoagulable I-problem
state I-problem
, O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
source O
for O
the B-problem
repeated I-problem
clots I-problem
. O

Because O
of O
the B-problem
bleeding I-problem
problems I-problem
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
full B-treatment
heparinization I-treatment
would O
not O
be O
prudent O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
pneumo-boots B-treatment
and O
subcutaneous B-treatment
heparin I-treatment
. O

Attention O
was O
paid O
to O
a O
variety O
of O
metabolic B-problem
and I-problem
electrolyte I-problem
abnormalities I-problem
, O
which O
were O
corrected O
appropriately O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
Mr. O
Less O
continued O
to O
remain O
critically B-problem
ill I-problem
with O
only O
very O
transient O
mild O
improvement O
with O
drainage B-treatment
of O
additional B-problem
retroperitoneal I-problem
fluid I-problem
. O

He O
remained O
pressor B-problem
dependent I-problem
, O
as O
well O
as O
dependent O
upon O
mechanical O
ventilatory O
assistance O
. O

His O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
atrial B-problem
fibrillation I-problem
requiring O
cardioversion B-treatment
. O

He O
had O
an B-problem
ongoing I-problem
requirement I-problem
for O
high B-problem
volume I-problem
resuscitation I-problem
and O
was O
persistently B-problem
acidotic I-problem
despite O
CV-VVH B-treatment
in O
the O
face O
of O
bicarbonate B-treatment
replenishment I-treatment
. O

The O
patient O
also O
appeared O
to O
have O
stool B-problem
from I-problem
his I-problem
Jackson-Pratt I-problem
site I-problem
and O
right B-problem
oblique I-problem
incision I-problem
. O

Bloody B-treatment
drainage I-treatment
from O
his B-problem
increasingly I-problem
distended I-problem
abdomen I-problem
was O
noted O
. O

Extensive O
discussions O
were O
carried O
out O
with O
Mrs. O
Less O
condition O
was O
irretrievable B-problem
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
continued B-problem
massive I-problem
retroperitoneal I-problem
contamination I-problem
and O
probable O
multiple B-problem
enteric I-problem
fistulae I-problem
from O
an B-problem
ischemic I-problem
bowel I-problem
. O

Dr. O
Cantsleddjesc O
felt O
that O
no O
surgical O
approach O
to O
this O
problem O
or O
further B-treatment
intervention I-treatment
or O
radiologic B-test
procedures I-test
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

All O
physicians O
and O
the O
family O
were O
in O
agreement O
that O
the O
most O
appropriate O
approach O
was O
to O
institute O
comfort O
measures O
. O

This O
was O
done O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
appeared O
to O
be O
comfortable O
at O
the O
time O
of O
death O
with O
his O
family O
at O
his O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O

TREATMENT O
: O

Mr. O
Finger O
was O
admitted O
for O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a B-problem
stroke I-problem
syndrome I-problem
involving O
his B-problem
left I-problem
middle I-problem
cerebral I-problem

. O

He O
underwent O
neurovascular B-test
doppler I-test

in O
either O

, O
there O
were O

He O
had O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
the O
first O
hospital O
day O
, O
the B-test
patient I-test
&apos;s I-test
exam I-test
deteriorated O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
appeared O
to O
be O
blood B-problem
pressure I-problem
dependent I-problem
. O

He O
had O
been O
started O
on O
Heparin B-treatment
from O
the O
time O
of O
his O
admission O
. O

A B-test
computerized I-test

had O
showed O
multiple B-problem

Because O
of O
his B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
, O
dependence O
of O
his O
left O
sided O
extremities O
, O
the O
lower O

specifically O
, O
he O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
where O
he O
underwent O
hypertensive B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
for O
several O
days O
. O

His B-test
systolic I-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
goal I-test
was O
initially O
170-190 O
, O
which O
he O
was O
able O
to O
achieve O
spontaneously O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
clear O
benefit O
at O
this O
level O
, O
and O
further B-problem
deterioration I-problem
in I-problem
his I-problem
left I-problem
sided I-problem
strength I-problem
, O
this O
goal O
was O
increased O
and O
Neo-Synephrine O
was O
added O
to O
his B-treatment
regimen I-treatment
to O
achieve O
mean O
arterial B-test
pressures I-test
in O
the O
110-120 O
range O
. O

This O
strategy O
and O
its B-problem
incumbent I-problem
risks I-problem
, O
particularly O
in O
a O
patient O
on O
Heparin B-treatment
, O
were O
discussed O
at O
length O
with O
both O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
family O
, O
who O
were O
very O
clear O
in O
wanting O
to O
proceed O
with O
all O
possible O
efforts O
to O
save O
the O
use O
of O
his O
left O
leg O
. O

While O
in O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
, O
his O
strength O
deteriorated O
from O
being O
able O
to O
hold O
his O
left O
leg O
off O
the O
bed O
up O
to O
several O
inches O
to O
loosing O
virtually O
all O
distal O
extremity O
strength O
, O
and O
having O
a O
2-3/5 O
power O
in O
his O
proximal O
left O
leg O
groups O
. O

He O
also O
, O
as O
Neo-Synephrinewas O
tapered O
, O
developed O
mild B-problem
sensory I-problem
findings I-problem
, O
in O
particular O
diminished O
large O
fiber O
sensibility O
in O
his O
left O
hand O
, O
although O
he O
at O
times O
, O
including O
near O
the O
end O
of O
his O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
had O
a O
right O
gaze O
preference O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
exploring O
his O
visual O
space O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
look O
to O
the O
left O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
possible O
to O
elicit O
clear O
evidence O
for O
a B-problem
field I-problem
deficit I-problem
. O

He O
was O
followed O
by O
speech O
and O
swallowing O
service O
, O
who O
assisted O
in O
the O
management O
of O
po O
intake O
which O
gradually O
improved O
, O
although O
he O
clearly O
had O
problems B-problem
with I-problem
manipulation I-problem
of I-problem
food I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
left I-problem
side I-problem
of I-problem
his I-problem
mouth I-problem
and O
would O
tend O
to O
accumulate O
a O
pouch O
of O
food O
in O
his O
left O
cheek O
. O

I O
should O
mention O
that O
his B-treatment
blood I-treatment
pressure I-treatment
therapy I-treatment
was O
at O
times O
limited O
by O
a B-problem
severe I-problem
headache I-problem
, O
although O
he O
also O
had O
this O
off O
the B-treatment
pressor I-treatment
. O

He O
had O
several B-test
repeat I-test
imaging I-test
studies I-test
during O
his O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
stay O
which O
showed O
further O
demarcation O
, O
but O
not O
extension O
of O
his B-problem
prior I-problem
infarct I-problem
, O
both O
on O
computerized B-test
tomography I-test
scan I-test
and O
DWI B-test
images I-test
. O

Additionally O
, O
he O
had O
a B-test
perfusion I-test
, O
diffusion B-test
MR I-test
study I-test
earlier O
on O
, O
which O
suggested O
the O
presence O
of O
viable B-problem
penumbra I-problem
, O
including O
the B-problem
overlying I-problem
cortex I-problem
. O

He O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
regular O
neurology O
floor O
once O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
he O
was O
not O
receiving O
any O
significant O
benefit O
from O
hypertensive B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
his B-test
neurologic I-test
exam I-test
is O
notable O
for O
hemiplegia B-problem
of I-problem
his I-problem

outside O
hospital O
for O
evaluation B-test
and O
treatment B-treatment
of O
adenocarcinoma B-problem
involving I-problem
the I-problem
transverse I-problem
colon I-problem
and O
gallbladder B-problem
. O

At O
the O
outside O
hospital O
the O
patient O
had O
already O
seemed O
some B-test
workup I-test

a O
couple O
weeks O
duration O
of O
bilateral B-problem
upper I-problem
quadrant I-problem
pain I-problem
which O
occasionally O
radiated O
to O
her O
back O
. O

She O
was O
also O
complaining O
of O
fatigue B-problem
for O
two O
weeks O
but O
a O

. O

A B-test
CAT I-test
scan I-test
of I-test
the I-test
abdomen I-test
showed O
air-fluid B-problem
levels I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
gallbladder I-problem
. O

It O
also O
showed O
a B-problem
thickened I-problem
gallbladder I-problem
wall I-problem
as O
well O
as O
a B-problem
dilated I-problem
common I-problem
bile I-problem

. O

Incidentally O
, O
it O
also O
showed O
diverticulosis B-problem
. O

A B-test
HIDA I-test
scan I-test
at O
the O
other O
hospital O
did O
not O
show O

of I-problem
the I-problem
gallbladder I-problem
indicating O
some O
sort O
of O

cystic B-problem
duct I-problem
obstruction I-problem
. O

The B-test
first I-test
imaging I-test
study I-test
that O
was O
done O
at O
Hahnemann O
General O
Hospital O
was O
a B-test
MRCP I-test
which O
revealed O
an B-problem
enhanced I-problem
thickened I-problem
gallbladder I-problem
wall I-problem
consistent O
with O
chronic B-problem
cholecystitis I-problem
. O

A B-test
differential I-test
according O
to O
the B-test
imaging I-test
included O
a B-problem
fistula I-problem
with O
adjacent B-problem
inflammatory I-problem
change I-problem
but O
also O
carcinoma B-problem
or O
adenomatosis B-problem
. O

In O
addition, O
also O
the O
MRCP O
showed O
a B-problem
mass I-problem
near I-problem
the I-problem
region I-problem
of I-problem
the I-problem
neck I-problem
of I-problem
the I-problem
gallbladder I-problem
. O

Of O
note O
, O
at O
the O
outside O
hospital O
, O
an B-test
endoscopy I-test
and O
colonoscopy B-test
were O
performed O
. O

The B-test
colonoscopy I-test
showed O
two B-problem
polyps I-problem
and O
also O
a B-problem
region I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
transverse I-problem
colon I-problem
that O
was O
biopsied O
. O

This B-test
biopsy I-test
came O
back O
as O
positive O
for O
adenocarcinoma B-problem
. O

patient O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
4/28/95 O
. O

An B-test
exploratory I-test
laparotomy I-test
was O
performed O
. O

The O
splenic O
flexure O
had O
a B-problem
purulent I-problem
exudative I-problem
process I-problem
along O
the O
antimesenteric O
surface O
. O

Thus O
, O
the B-problem
splenic I-problem
flexure I-problem
and O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
descending O
colon O
were O
resected O
. O

The O
patient O
underwent O
a B-treatment
left I-treatment
colectomy I-treatment
with O
end B-treatment
transverse I-treatment
colostomy I-treatment
, O
and O
oversewing B-treatment
of I-treatment
the I-treatment
descending I-treatment
colon I-treatment
. O

Drainage B-treatment
of O
the B-problem
pancreatic I-problem
necrosis I-problem
was O
also O
done O
. O

The O
patient O
tolerated O
the B-treatment
procedure I-treatment
fairly O
well O
, O
and O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

In O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
prolonged O
course O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
then O
extubated O
on O
postoperative O
day O
#2 O
, O
but O
remained O
pressor-dependent B-problem
. O

He O
remained O
on O
imipenem B-treatment
, O
and O
Vancomycin B-treatment
was O
also O
started O
. O

Thereafter O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
a O
long O
and O
complicated O
postoperative O
course O
. O

He O
was O
eventually O
transferred O
to O
the O

, O
where O
he O
remained O

. O

He O
had O
repeated O
episodes O
of O

diastolic O
. O

These O
resolved O
without O
incident O
. O

He O
also O
had O
repeated B-problem
temperature I-problem
spikes I-problem
. O

After O
repeated O
work O
ups O
, O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
these O
were O
probably O
due O
to O
remaining B-problem
infection I-problem
in I-problem
the I-problem
peripancreatic I-problem
area I-problem
. O

His B-treatment
drainage I-treatment
tube I-treatment
from O
the O
peripancreatic O
area O
was O
gradually O
advanced O
, O
and O
eventually O
discontinued O

placed O
on O
multiple O
courses O
of O

. O

Most O
recently O
, O

of O
Vancomycin B-treatment
, O
ofloxacin B-treatment
, O
and O
Flagyl B-treatment
, O
for O

for O
gram B-problem
positive I-problem
cocci I-problem
and O
enteric B-problem
and O
non-enteric B-problem
gram I-problem
negative I-problem
rods I-problem
. O

This O
28 O
day O
course O
was O
completed O
on O
07/15/95 O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
also O
treated O
initially O
with O
amphotericin-B B-treatment
and O
then O
with O
fluconazole B-treatment
for O
a B-test
computerized I-test

of O
a B-problem
small I-problem
fluid I-problem
collection I-problem
around I-problem
his I-problem
pancreas I-problem
, O
which O
grew O
Candida B-problem

. O

The O
patient O
also O
had O
several O
episodes O
of O
fungal B-problem
cystitis I-problem
with O
Torulopsis B-problem
glabrata I-problem
, O
going O
from O
his B-test
urine I-test
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
amphotericin-B B-treatment
bladder I-treatment

for O
this O
. O

Mr. O
Mass O
was O
initially O
anticoagulated O
for O
his B-problem
left I-problem
ventricular I-problem

. O

He O
remained O
stable O
from O
a O
cardiac O
fashion O
. O

He O
did O
have O
problems B-problem
with I-problem
po I-problem
intake I-problem
. O

He O
had O
repeated O
bouts O
of O
small-volume B-problem
emesis I-problem
that O
may O
have O
been O
secondary O
to O
reflux B-problem
. O

He O
was O
treated O
with O
a O
variety O
of O
anti-emetics B-treatment
, O
most O
recently O
Granisetron O
, O
with O
only O
mild O
success O
. O

He O
remained O
total B-treatment
parenteral I-treatment
nutrition-dependent I-treatment
throughout O
his O
hospital O
course O
. O

By O
the O
end O
of O
June O
, O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
Mr. O
Mass O
would O
require O
aggressive B-treatment
surgical I-treatment
intervention I-treatment
in O
order O
to O
eradicate O
his B-problem
intra-abdominal I-problem
bursts I-problem
of O

long O
discussions O
with O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
was O
his O
health-care O
proxy O
, O
revealed O
that O
they O
felt O
that O
no O
further B-treatment
aggressive I-treatment

be O
attempted O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
been O
made O
a O

and O
also O
for O
possible O
post B-problem
obstructive I-problem
picture I-problem
that O
she O
would O
be O
at O
risk O
for O
given O
her B-problem
pulmonary I-problem
anatomy I-problem
. O

As O
the O
Hubbard O
Regional O
Hospital O
hospital O
course O
went O
on O
the O
patient O
's O
respiratory O
did O
not O
show O
mild O
improvement O
on O
the B-treatment
ventilator I-treatment
. O

She O
was O
able O
to O
oxygenate B-treatment
originally O
. O

Unfortunately O
her B-problem
mental I-problem
status I-problem
failed O
to O
improve O
despite O
having O
been O
off O
all B-treatment
sedative I-treatment
medications I-treatment
for O
several O
days O
. O

Later O
in O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
family O
meetings O
took O
place O
and O
given O
the O
patient O
's O
overall O
poor O
prognosis O
with O
decreased B-problem
mental I-problem
status I-problem
it O
was O
decided O
that O
the O
patient O
would O
become O
CMO O
. O

Subsequently O
she O
was O
extubated O
on O
06-28 O
. O

The O
patient O
continues O
to O
actually O
ventilate O
well O
off O
of O
the O
respiratory O

However O
, O
she O
is O
CMO O
and O
will O
not O
be O
intubated B-treatment
for O
respiratory B-problem
distress I-problem
. O

2. O
Cardiovascular O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
initially O
transferred O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
thought O
to O
be O
exhibiting B-problem
septic I-problem
physiology I-problem
, O
respiratory B-problem
distress I-problem
and O
hypotensive B-problem
. O

She O
required O
aggressive B-treatment
intravenous I-treatment
fluids I-treatment
and O
later O
required O
pressor B-treatment
support I-treatment
with O
neo-synephrine B-treatment
. O

Later O
during O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
she O
was O
felt O
to O
be O
somewhat B-problem
overloaded I-problem
and O
intravenous B-treatment
fluids I-treatment
were O
cut O
back O
. O

It O
was O
quite O
difficult O
weaning O
her O
off O
of O
neo-synephrine B-treatment
. O

She O
was O
also O
given O
stress B-treatment
dose I-treatment
steroids I-treatment
. O

Later O
in O
her O
hospital O
course O
she O
also O
had O
an B-test
echocardiogram I-test
for O
question O
of O
new B-test
ECG I-test
findings O
in O
her B-problem
inferior I-problem
leads I-problem
. O

Her B-test
echocardiogram I-test
, O
however O
, O
was O
essentially O
normal O
with O
an B-test
ejection I-test
fraction I-test
of O
55% O
without O
any B-problem
gross I-problem
wall I-problem
motion I-problem
abnormalities I-problem
or O
valvular B-problem
pathology I-problem
. O

As O
mentioned O
above O
the O
patient O
's O
hemodynamic O
status O
was O
tenuous O
throughout O
her O
hospital O
course O
as O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
wean O
the O
patient O
off O
of O
neo-synephrine B-treatment
. O

By O
06-28 O
, O
however O
, O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
off O
of O
neo-synephrine B-treatment
, O
but O
at O
this O
time O
as O
mentioned O
above O
the O
patient O
was O
deemed O
to O
be O
CMO O
per O
discussion O
with O
physicians O
and O
her O

malignancy I-problem
and O
also O
a O
history O
of O
pulmonary B-problem
embolisms I-problem
from O
2012-04-23 O
. O

Earlier O
in O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
the O
team O
was O
concerned O
about O
possible O
pulmonary B-problem
embolisms I-problem
as O
a O
possible O
source O
of O
the B-problem
patient I-problem
's I-problem
respiratory I-problem
decompensation I-problem
. O

However O
, O
the O
patient O
also O
had O
brain B-problem
metastasis I-problem
and O
at O
this O
point O
anticoagulation O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
contraindication O
given O
risk O
for O
hemorrhage B-problem
into I-problem
these I-problem
tumors I-problem
. O

She O
did O
have O
lower B-test
extremity I-test
doppler I-test
ultrasounds I-test
, O
which O
were O
negative O
. O

4. O
Infectious O

: O

As O
mentioned O
above O
patient O
initially O
hypotension B-problem
, O
febrile B-problem
and O
in O
respiratory B-problem
distress I-problem
presumed O
to O
be O
septic B-problem
source I-problem
likely O
pulmonary O
. O

Initially O
the O
patient O
was O
treated O
with O
broad B-treatment
spectrum I-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
including O
Vancomycin B-treatment
, O
Ceptaz B-treatment
, O
Levaquin B-treatment
, O
Clindamycin B-treatment
and O
_________. B-treatment

All O
of O
her B-test
cultures I-test
are O
negative O
to O
date O
. O

She O
was O
negative O
for O
PCP O
and O
subsequently B-treatment
_____________ I-treatment
was O
continued O
and O
Clindamycin B-treatment
was O
changed O
for O
anaerobic B-treatment
coverage I-treatment
. O

In O
addition O
her B-treatment
Vancomycin I-treatment
and O
Levaquin B-treatment
were O
also O
discontinued O
. O

The O
patient O
remained O
afebrile B-problem
during O
the O
majority O
of O
her B-treatment
hospital I-treatment
course I-treatment
. O

By O
virtue O
of O
discussions O
on O
06-28 O
the O
patient O
was O
deemed O
to O
be O
CMO O
and O
all B-treatment
antibiotics I-treatment
were O
withdrawn O
at O
this O
point O
. O

5. O
Gastroenterology O
: O

The O
patient O
had O
an B-test
abdominal I-test
CT I-test
earlier O
in O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
, O
which O
was O
essentially O
negative O
for O
an B-problem
intraabdominal I-problem
pathology I-problem
. O

She O
was O
initially O
supported O
with O
tube B-treatment
feeds I-treatment
during O
her O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
course O
, O
but O
at O
this O
point O
the O
patient O
is O
CMO O
and O

have O
been O
subsequently O
discontinued O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

Ms. O
Shuffa O
underwent O
an B-treatment
EGD I-treatment
and O
flexible B-test
bronchoscopy I-test
on O
9/16/00 O
shortly O
after O
she O
arrived O
. O

This O
showed O
tracheal B-treatment
compressions I-treatment
but O
no O
other B-problem
lesions I-problem
that O
were O
obvious O
at O
the O
time O
. O

She O
was O
hemodynamically O
stable O
and O
remained O
on O
the B-treatment
ventilator I-treatment
. O

The O
differential O
diagnoses O
at O
this O
point O
consisted O
of O
hematoma B-problem
vs. O
neoplasm B-problem
vs. O
an B-problem
abscess I-problem
vs. O
a B-problem
thyroid I-problem
tumor I-problem
. O

On O
9/22/00 O
, O
she O
underwent O
a B-treatment
cervical I-treatment
mediastinoscopy I-treatment
. O

A B-test
biopsy I-test
of O
this B-problem
mass I-problem
was O
consistent O
with O
hematoma B-problem
. O

The O
operative O
report O
shows O
that O
there O
was O
an B-problem
abnormal I-problem
area I-problem
below O
the O
trachea O
to O
the O
left O
which O
represented O
a O
cavity O
between O
the O
esophagus O
, O
trachea O
, O
aorta O
, O
and O
spine O
that O
was O
full O
of O
clot B-problem
. O

There O
was O
no O
active B-problem
bleeding I-problem
at O
the O
time O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
several O
days O
, O
the O
patient O
remained O
hemodynamically O
stable O
on O
the B-treatment
ventilator I-treatment
. O

She O
had O
an B-problem
elevated I-problem
calcium I-problem
level I-problem
that O
raised O
the O
suspicion O
that O
this B-problem
mass I-problem
could O
be O
a B-problem
hematoma I-problem
coming O
from O
a B-problem
ruptured I-problem
parathyroid I-problem
adenoma I-problem
. O

The B-test
ionized I-test
calcium I-test
was O
elevated O
as O
was O
the O
parathormone O
level O
. O

Given O
these O
findings O
, O
she O
underwent O
a B-test
Sestamibi I-test
scan I-test
. O

The B-test
Sestamibi I-test
scan I-test
showed O
findings O
that O
were O
consistent O
with O
a B-problem
parathyroid I-problem
adenoma I-problem
in O
the O
right O
lobe O
of O
the O
thyroid O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
it O
was O
believed O
that O
her B-problem
clot I-problem
was O
due O
to O
a B-problem
rupture I-problem
of O
this B-problem
parathyroid I-problem
adenoma I-problem
. O

Dr. O
Ear O
brought O
the O
patient O
to O
the O
operating O
room O
on O
10/5/00 O
. O

She O
underwent O
a B-test
parathyroid I-test
exploration I-test
with O
resection B-treatment
of O
a B-problem
ruptured I-problem
ectopic I-problem
right I-problem
upper I-problem
parathyroid I-problem
adenoma I-problem
, O
a B-test
biopsy I-test
of O
a O
normal O
left O

parathyroids I-treatment
, O
resection B-treatment
of O
a B-treatment
left I-treatment
upper I-treatment
parathyroid I-treatment
, O
and O
tracheostomy B-treatment
. O

She O
tolerated O
the B-treatment
procedure I-treatment
well O
and O
was O
transferred O
back O
to O
the O
Surgical O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
with O
her B-treatment
new I-treatment
tracheostomy I-treatment
working O
well O
. O

Her O
postoperative O
course O
was O
complicated O
by O
serosanguineous B-problem
pleural I-problem
effusion I-problem
on I-problem
the I-problem
left I-problem
. O

This O
required O
a B-treatment
chest I-treatment
tube I-treatment
. O

Her B-test
hematocrit I-test
continued O
to O
drop O
over O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
days O
despite O
normal O
platelet O
count O
, O
normal O
coags O
, O
and O
no O
obvious O
source O
of O
bleeding B-problem
. O

It O
was O
believed O
that O
she O
was O
continuing B-problem
to I-problem
bleed I-problem
in I-problem
her I-problem
chest I-problem
. O

However O
, O
we O
are O
not O
quite O
sure O
why O
this O
was O
occurring O
. O

She O
underwent O
an B-test
extensive I-test
workup I-test
by O
Hematology O
that O
revealed O
a B-problem
bleeding I-problem
diatheses I-problem
of O
unknown O
etiology O
. O

It O
turns O
out O
that O
several O
people O
in O
her O
family O
have O
a B-problem
similar I-problem
bleeding I-problem
diathesis I-problem
of O
unknown O
etiology O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
by O
systems O
: O

1. O
Neuro B-problem
. O

The O
patient O
became O
intermittently B-problem
agitated I-problem
. O

We O
have O
been O
giving O
her B-treatment
Haldol I-treatment
at O
bedtime O
as O
well O
as O
Ativan B-treatment
p.r.n. O
throughout O
the O

. O

She O
responds O

She O
speaks O
some O
English O
and O
seems O
to O
understand O
more O
than O
she O

. O

She O
has O
a O
family O
member O
who O
is O
present O
for O
approximately O
12 O
hours O
each O
day O
. O

She O
has O
been O
very O
helpful O
in O
translating O
and O
seems O
to O
say O
that O
Ms. O
Shuffa O
is O
in O
good O

The B-test

q.d. O
She O
occasionally O
gets O
hypertensive B-problem
when O
she O
is O
agitated B-problem
. O

For O
this O
, O
we O
have O
given O
her O
10 O
mg O
of O
hydralazine B-treatment
. O

Her B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
responds I-test
well O
to O
this O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
she O
is O
in O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
and O
has O
been O
hemodynamically O
stable O
throughout O
her O
hospitalization O
. O

The O
patient O
developed O
a B-treatment
left I-treatment
femoral I-treatment
artery I-treatment
pseudoaneurysm I-treatment
after O
placement O
of O
a B-treatment
Greenfield I-treatment
filter I-treatment
. O

This O
has O
been O
followed O
by O
the O
Vascular O
Surgery O

here O
at O
the O
Ingree O
and O
Ot O
of O
Weamanshy O
Medical O

has O
been O
consulted O
. O

The B-problem
aneurysm I-problem
at O
the O
time O
of O

is O
approximately O
2.5 O
cm O
. O

They O
elected O
not O
to O
inject O
it O
with O
thrombin B-treatment
. O

They O
asked O
that O
the O
patient O
follow-up O
with O
Dr. O
Ear O
in O
approximately O
three O
to O
four O
weeks O
so O
that O
this B-problem
aneurysm I-problem
can I-problem
be O
assessed O
. O

They O
have O
opted O
for O
conservative B-treatment
management I-treatment
given O
the O

3. O
Respiratory B-problem
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
the O
patient O
remained O
on O
CPAP B-treatment
with O
a B-test
PEEP I-test
of O
7.5 O
and O
a B-test
pressure I-test
support I-test
of O

. O

She O
seems O
to O
be O
tolerating O
this O
well O
as O
she O
has O
an B-test
O2 I-test
sat I-test
of O
100% O
on O
40% O
FIO2 O
. O

Her B-test
chest I-test
x-ray I-test
shows O
a B-problem
left I-problem
lower I-problem
lobe I-problem
hematoma I-problem
that O
had O
greatly O
improved O
in O
the O
last O
few O
days O
. O

Her O
right O
lung O
field O
is O
clear O
. O

Her B-treatment
tracheostomy I-treatment
is O
functioning O
well O
, O
and O
we O
have O
had O
no O
problems B-problem
with O
it O
. O

She O
will O
obviously O
need O
to O
be O
weaned O
as O
tolerated O
. O

We O
had O
her O
down O
to O
a B-problem
low I-problem
pressure I-problem
support I-problem
of O
7 O
in O
the O
last O
week O
. O

With O
the B-treatment
pressure I-treatment
support I-treatment
at O
7 O
, O
she O
became O
tachypneic B-problem
and O
had O
to O
be O
brought O
back O
up O
to O
10 O
. O

Her B-test
oxygen I-test
saturation I-test
has O
always O
been O
good O
. O

4. O
GI B-problem
. O

The O
patient O
is O
getting O
tube B-treatment

via O
her B-treatment
NG I-treatment
tube I-treatment
of I-treatment
full I-treatment
strength I-treatment
Jevity I-treatment
of O
75 O
cc O
per O

. O

This O
is O
her O
goal O
. O

She O
tolerates O
them O
very O
well O
and O
has O
approximately O
200 O
cc O
to O
300 O
cc O
of O
stool O
per O
day O
. O

Last O
week O
, O
she O
had O
copious B-problem
amounts I-problem
of I-problem
stool I-problem
in O
the O
range O
of O
500 O
cc O
to O
1000 O
cc O
of O

stool O
per O

. O

Stool B-test

have O
been O
sent O
numerous O
times O
as O
well O
as O
analysis O
for O
C. B-problem
difficile I-problem

. O

These O
have O
all O
been O
negative O
. O

We O
believe O
the O
this O
was O
an B-problem
osmotic I-problem
diarrhea I-problem
. O

Since O
her B-treatment
tube I-treatment
feeds I-treatment
have O
been O
changed O
from O
full O
strength O
Nephro O
to O
Jevity O
, O
her B-problem
diarrhea I-problem
has O
resolved O
. O

She O
has O
been O
taking O
Zantac B-treatment
, O
and O
the O
pH O
of O
her B-test
NG I-test
tube I-test
residuals I-test
have O
been O
in O
the O
5 O
to O
8 O
range O
. O

5. O
GU B-problem
. O

The O
patient O
has O
had O
hypernatremia B-problem
. O

She O
is O
approximately O
10 O
kg O
up O
her O
overall O
body O
weight O
. O

We O
believe O
her O
to O
still O
be O
total B-problem
body I-problem
overloaded I-problem
. O

Over O
the O
last O
several O
days O
, O
we O
have O
been O
giving O
her O
approximately O
500 O
cc O
to O
1000 O
cc O
of O
free O
water O
through O
her B-treatment
NG I-treatment
tube I-treatment
. O

We O
also O
have O
been O
diuresing O
her O
with O
Bumex B-treatment
. O

This O
seems O
to O
trend O
her B-problem
sodium I-problem
down O
. O

This O
will O
need O
to O
be O
monitored O
closely O
. O

Her B-test
BUN I-test
and O
creatinine B-test
have O
been O
normal O
, O
and O
she O
has O
always O
made O
good O
urine O
. O

6. O
Heme O
. O

As O
stated O
before O
, O
the O
patient O
continued O
to O
ooze O
into O
her O
pleural O
space O
well O
after O
her B-treatment
definitive I-treatment
operation I-treatment
. O

She O
had O
an B-test
extensive I-test
workup I-test
by O
Hematology O
which O
revealed O
a B-problem
bleeding I-problem
diathesis I-problem
of O
unknown O
origin O
. O

Before O
we O
removed O
her B-treatment
chest I-treatment
tube I-treatment
, O
we O
had O
to O
give O
her B-test
platelets I-test
. O

She O
had O
no O
problems B-problem
with O
this O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
, O
her B-test
hematocrit I-test
is O
stable O
in O
the O
28 O
to O
33 O
range O
. O

I O
stress O
that O
she O
cannot O
be O
anticoagulated O
. O

We O
have O
given O
her B-treatment
Lovenox I-treatment
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
she O
continues O
to O
bleed B-problem
. O

Therefore O
, O
she O
is O
on O
no O
DVT B-treatment
prophylaxis I-treatment
. O

She O
does O
have O
a B-problem
left I-problem
iliac I-problem
deep I-problem

. O

She O
has O
a B-treatment
Greenfield I-treatment

, O
and O
this O
is O
her O
only O
DVT B-treatment

At O
the O
time O
of O

, O
the O
patient O

She O

cerebrovascular B-problem
accident I-problem
. O

The O
patient O
suffered O
some B-problem
mild I-problem

which O
was O
attributed O
to O
stenosis B-problem
of I-problem
the I-problem

Holter I-test
showed O
up O

She O
was O

Her B-treatment

point O
, O
however O
it O
looks O
like O
it O
will O
be O
something O
around O

. O

Her O
pro O
time O
and O
PTT B-test
have O
normalized O
at O
the O

She O
needs O
to O
be O
given O
5 O
mg O
of O
Coumadin B-treatment
tonight O
, O
5/22/92 O
. O

In O
addition O
heparin B-treatment
should O
be O
started O
to O
drip B-treatment
on O
arrival O
at O
400 O
units O
an O
hour O
. O

It O
is O
discontinued O
at O
the O
time O
of O
transport O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
received O
physical B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
and O
occupational B-treatment
therapy I-treatment
and O
her O
recovery O
is O
near O
complete O
. O

During O
evaluation B-test
of O
her B-problem
neurologic I-problem
status I-problem
, O
it O
was O
determined O
that O
for O
several O
months O
prior O
to O
admission O
, O
the O
patient O
has O
been O
too O
unsteady B-problem
to I-problem
ambulate I-problem
. O

On O
our B-test
exam I-test
she O
is O
found O
to O
have O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
ataxia B-problem
, O
especially O
in O
the O
midline O
and O
the O
exact O
cause O
of O
this O
is O
unknown O
. O

There O
are O
multiple O
possible O
contributions O
and O
this O
is O
where O
her O
need O
for O
careful B-test
internal I-test
medical I-test
evaluation I-test
has O
arisen O
. O

At O
the O
time O
we O
were O
to O
embark O
on O
this B-test
evaluation I-test
, O
the O
patient O
&apos;s O
family O
strongly O
requested O
that O
she O
be O
transferred O
to O
the O
Sas O
General O
Hospital O
. O

What O
follows O
is O
a O
summary O
of O
her B-problem
medical I-problem
problems I-problem
and O
their O
possible O
relationship O
to O
her B-problem
ataxia I-problem
. O

Her B-problem
ataxia I-problem
is O
likely O
due O
to O
some B-problem
cerebellar I-problem
function I-problem
, O
though O
this O
is O
not O
certain O
. O

Moreover O
her B-test
MRI I-test
did O
not O
show O
any B-problem
discrete I-problem
cerebellar I-problem
lesions I-problem
. O

Our O
leading O
theory O
at O
this O
point O
is O
that O
her B-problem
cerebellar I-problem
dysfunction I-problem
relates O
to O
perineoplastic B-problem
syndrome I-problem
, O
relating O
to O
her O
history O
of O
breast B-problem
Ca I-problem
. O

As O
I O
mentioned O
above O
, O
her B-test
evaluation I-test
was O
limited O
by O
her O
cardiologic O
status O
at O
the O
time O
. O

While O
mammogram B-test
and O
CA-15.3 B-test
and O
breast B-test
exam I-test
are O
all O
normal O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
a B-problem
perineoplastic I-problem
syndrome I-problem
with O
or O
without O
concomitant B-problem
breast I-problem
Ca I-problem
has O
reared O
its O
head O
. O

Two O
possible O
markers O
are O
anti-Hu B-problem
syndrome I-problem
and O
anti-Yo B-test
antibody I-test
. O

These B-test
tests I-test
were O
sent O
on O
the O
18th O
and O
are O
pending O
at O
the O
time O
of O
discharge O
. O

The O
results O
can O
be O
obtained O
by O
paging O

Joasscchird O
, O
M.D. O
at O
834-364-2251 O
. O

I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
furnish O
the O
results O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
MI B-problem
in O
1989 O
. O

Echocardiogram B-test
no O
longer O
shows O
wall B-problem
motion I-problem
abnormalities I-problem
. O

EKG B-test
, O
when O
the O
patient O
goes O
out O
of O
left B-problem
bundle I-problem
branch I-problem
block I-problem
transiently I-problem
shows O
an B-problem
anterolateral I-problem
Q/wave I-problem
inversion I-problem
. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
discontinue O
her B-treatment
Isordil I-treatment
to O
improve O
upon O
some B-problem
orthostatic I-problem
hypotension I-problem
, O
but O
we O
are O
not O
certain O
whether O
her B-problem
heart I-problem
will O
tolerate O
this O
. O

Persantine B-problem
thallium I-problem
is O
scheduled O
at O
this O
time O
, O
but O
is O
yet O
to O
be O
performed O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
orthostatic B-problem
hypotension I-problem
x O
many O
years O
. O

It O
has O
been O
evaluated O
in O
the O
past O
without O
success O
. O

During O
her O
hospitalization O
, O
we O
confirmed O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
, O
even O
when O
she O
was O
hydrated O
with O
saline B-treatment
, O
to O
a B-test
fractional I-test
excretion I-test
of I-test
sodium I-test
of O
2% O
. O

Studies B-test
of I-test
her I-test
autonomic I-test
system I-test
did O
not O
document O
any B-problem
dysautonomia I-problem
. O

Studies O
of O
skin B-test
galvanic I-test
conduction I-test
were O
normal O
and O
her B-test
RR I-test
interval I-test
evaluation I-test
was O
not O
abnormal B-problem
. O

This O
is O
a B-problem
chronic I-problem
problem I-problem
but O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
her B-problem
current I-problem
weakness I-problem
and O
inability B-problem
to I-problem
walk I-problem
. O

Florinef B-treatment
is O
to O
be O
considered O
, O
however O
stopping O
the O
Isordil O
is O
one O
goal O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
bronchiectasis B-problem
from O
a B-problem
childhood I-problem
pneumonia I-problem
. O

In O
addition O
there O
is O
a O
distant O
history O
of O
M. B-problem
kansasaii I-problem
infection I-problem
. O

This O
has O
been O
evaluated O
by O
Dr. O
Screen O
at O
Sas O
General O
Hospital O
and O
probably O
relates O
to O
her B-test
lung I-test
xray I-test
. O

CT B-test
at O
the O
Ona O
Hospital O
in O
1989 O
showed O
similar O
findings O
. O

A B-test
chest I-test
CT I-test
was O
to O
be O
performed O
and O
may O
be O
yielding O
. O

A B-test
PPD I-test
was O
placed O
and O
is O
to O
be O
read O
on O
Saturday O
, O
4 O
26th O
. O

The O
left O
volar O
forearm O
has O
the O
PPD O
just O
proximal O
to O
the O
wrist O
crease O
and O
a B-problem
candida I-problem
albicans I-problem
placed O
just O
distal O
to O
the O
antecubital O
fossa O
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
deep B-problem
venous I-problem
thrombosis I-problem
in O
1990 O
, O
for O
which O
she O
received O
6 O
months O
of O
Coumadin B-treatment
. O

Dopplers B-test
of I-test
her I-test
lower I-test
extremities I-test
were O
negative O
on O
this O
admission O
. O

It O
is O
doubtful O
that O
she O
has O
chronic B-problem
PE I-problem
, O
but O
this O
is O
one O
consideration O
. O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
she O
has O
pulmonary B-problem
hypertension I-problem
from O
her B-problem
lung I-problem
disease I-problem
, O
and O
so O
this O
is O
a O
consideration O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
mild B-problem
hyponatremia I-problem
during O
this B-treatment
hospitalization I-treatment
with O
a B-test
sodium I-test
as O
low O
as O
131 O
. O

We O
think O
this O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
an B-problem
SIADH I-problem
as O
she O
is O
euvolemic B-problem
. O

This O
can O
be O
evaluated O
further O
and O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
at O
this O
time O
. O

The O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

1. O
HYPOGLYCEMIA B-problem
: O

The O
patient O
had O
been O
initially O
very B-problem
hypoglycemic I-problem
on O
admission O
secondary O
to O
overdosing B-treatment
on O
insulin B-treatment
; O
however O
, O
with O
glucose B-treatment
repletion I-treatment
both O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Department O
and O
in O
the O
ICU O
, O
this O
resolved O
and O
the O
patient O
also O
began O
to O
eat O
. O

We O
checked O
fingerstick B-test
glucoses I-test
q.i.d. O
and O
at O
3:00 O
a.m. O

His B-test
glucose I-test
on O
the O
morning O
of O
discharge O
was O
about O
60 O
so O
we O
opted O
to O
decrease O
his B-treatment
p.m. I-treatment
NPH I-treatment
dose I-treatment
slightly O
for O
discharge O
and O
continue O
covering O
him O
with O
sliding B-treatment
scale I-treatment
insulin I-treatment
. O

He O
should O
also O
continue O
having O
a B-treatment
snack I-treatment
at O
midnight O
if O
able O
. O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
he O
required O
a O
much O
greater O
amount O
of O
insulin B-treatment
as O
an O
outpatient O
due O
to O
poor O
compliance O
with O
Richard O
Natalie O
diet O
. O

2. O
ALCOHOL O
ABUSE O
: O

It O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
patient O
continues O
to O
drink O
more O
than O
he O
admits O
. O

He O
did O
have O
past O
alcoholism O
consisting O
of O
a O
half O
a O
pint O
of O
brandy O
per O
day O
for O
three O
years O
but O
supposedly O
had O
quit O
in O
2009-09-03 O
. O

He O
had O
been O
on O
a B-treatment
diazepam I-treatment
CIWA I-treatment
scale I-treatment
prophylaxis I-treatment
against O
DT O
s; O
however O
, O
he O
had O
a B-problem
very I-problem
low I-problem
CIWA I-problem
scale I-problem
during O
his O
entire O
admission O
and O
did O
not O
need O
any B-treatment
benzodiazepines I-treatment
. O

This O
alcohol O
abuse O
may O
be O
further O
addressed O
as O
an O
inpatient O
on O
the O
Psychiatry O
Quincy O
Medical O
Center O
. O

We O
had O
also O
requested O
a O
Social O
Work O
consult O
regarding O
this O
. O

3. O
DEPRESSION B-problem
vs. O
Borderline B-problem
personality I-problem
disorder I-problem
: O

The O
patient O
has O
had O
several O
admissions O
in O
the O
past O
for O
attempted O
suicide O
with O
overdose B-problem
of O
his B-treatment
insulin I-treatment
and O
though O
he O
denied O
at O
this O
time O
attempting O
to O
end O
his O
life O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
social O
situation O
of O
increased B-problem
stressors I-problem
corresponding I-problem
to O
this O
time O
suggest O
that O
this O
is O
not O
the O
truth O
. O

He O
received O
a O
one-to-one O
sitter O
during O
his O
admission O
and O
will O
be O
transferred O
to O
the O
Psychiatry O
HealthSouth O
New O
England O
Rehab O
Hospital O
to O
ensure O
the O
patient O
's O
safety O
and O
initiate O
further B-treatment
antidepressant I-treatment
treatment I-treatment
. O

He O
will O
need O
close O
follow-up O
regarding O
his B-problem
depression I-problem
as O
an O
outpatient O
, O
although O
apparently O
this O
has O
been O
set O
up O
for O
him O
in O
the O
past O
and O
he O
had O
not O
followed O
through O
. O

4. O
HISTORY O
OF O
HIGH B-problem
BLOOD I-problem
PRESSURE I-problem
: O

His B-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
was O
fairly O
low O
with O
a O
maximum O
of O
130s O
systolic O
during O
his O
admission O
, O
thus O
we O
did O
not O
continue O
his B-treatment
lisinopril I-treatment
which O
he O
had O
been O
on O
in O
the O
past O
. O

5. O

as O
LFTs O
, O
amylase B-test
, O

which O
were O
all O

. O

He O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O

or O
gallstones B-problem
or O
any B-problem
abnormalities I-problem
with I-problem
the I-problem
liver I-problem
or I-problem
kidneys I-problem
. O

it O
is O
possible O
that O
he O
has O
had O
a B-problem

or O
other B-problem

cause I-problem
. O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
seen O
in O
consultation O
by O
Dr. O
Wire O
who O
felt O
that O
manipulation O
of O
the B-treatment
tracheal I-treatment
tube I-treatment
was O
the O
best O
approach O
to O
the B-problem
air I-problem
leak I-problem
since O
it O
was O
a O
new O
trach O
and O
he O
was O
requiring O
such O
high B-treatment
ventilator I-treatment
support I-treatment
that O
it O
was O
risky O
to O
change O
it O
. O

He O
also O
felt O
that O
lung B-test
biopsy I-test
at O
this O
time O
was O
rather O
risky O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
therefore O
completely O
cultured O
again O
and O
begun O
on O
antibiotic B-treatment
coverage I-treatment
which O
would O
take O
care O
of O
the B-problem
Pseudomonas I-problem
he O
was O
known O
to O
have O
. O

The B-treatment
steroids I-treatment
were O
tapered O
. O

He O
was O
also O
begun O
on O
anti-Candida B-treatment
regimen I-treatment
for O
his B-problem
urinary I-problem
tract I-problem
infection I-problem
with O
yeast B-problem
being O
seen O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
story O
of O
hemoptysis B-problem
, O
he O
also O
underwent O
an B-problem
exotic I-problem
bleeding I-problem
work O
up O
for O
such O
things O
as O
Wegner O
&apos;s O
and O
Goodpasture O
&apos;s O
. O

These O
results O
were O
all O
negative O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
require O
very B-problem
high I-problem
FIO2 I-problem
. O

He O
was O
found O
to O
have O
a B-problem
DVT I-problem
by O
ultrasound B-test
. O

He O
underwent O
a O
trial O
of O
TPA B-treatment
followed O
by O
heparin B-treatment
. O

This O
produced O

HOSPITAL O
COURSE O
AND O
TREATMENT O
: O

1) O
NEUROLOGY O
: O

The O
patient O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Neurology O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
for O
intensive B-test
monitoring I-test
due O
to O
his B-problem
frail I-problem
condition I-problem
. O

He O
had O
an B-test
electroencephalogram I-test
performed O
on O
his O
initial O
admittance O
to O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
which O
did O
not O
show O
any O
evidence O
of O
seizure B-problem
activity I-problem
. O

It O
did O
, O
however O
, O
show O
diffuse B-problem
slowing I-problem
. O

He O
was O
given O
1.5 O
grams O
of O
Dilantin B-treatment
in O
the O
emergency O
room O
as O
well O
as O
2 O
mgs O
of O
intravenous B-treatment
Ativan I-treatment
which O
did O
little O
to O
stop O
his B-problem
rhythmic I-problem
blinking I-problem
that O
he O
showed O
from O
time O
to O
time O
on O
examination B-test
. O

His B-problem
hypertension I-problem
; O
his B-test
high I-test
blood I-test
pressure I-test
was O
controlled O
with O
intravenous B-treatment
nitroglycerine I-treatment
in O
the O
early O
going O
and O
then O
he O
was O
switched O
to O
an B-treatment
oral I-treatment
regimen I-treatment
for O
better B-treatment
control I-treatment
after O
he O
was O
removed O
from O
the O
Intensive O
Care O
Unit O
. O

He O
continued O
to O
do O
well O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O
and O
was O
quite O
surprisingly O
intact O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
his O
body O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
ability O
to O
move O
. O

He O
did O
consistently O
have O
more O
movement O
on O
the O
left O
side O
of O
his O
body O
than O
on O
the O
right O
, O
but O
he O
gradually O
became O
more O
awake O
and O
alert O
and O
communicative O
and O
his B-treatment
endotracheal I-treatment
tube I-treatment
was O
removed O
on O
the O
second O
day O
of O
admission O
. O

His O
diagnosis O
of O
progressive B-problem
supranuclear I-problem
palsy I-problem
was O
placed O
under O
question O
on O
further B-test
examination I-test
of O
his O
eye O
movement O
since O
he O
was O
able O
to O
have O
excellent O
superior O
gaze O
especially O
with O
the B-problem
bells I-problem
phenomenon I-problem
which O
would O
not O
be O
seen O
with O
progressive B-problem
supranuclear I-problem
palsy I-problem
. O

It O
was O
felt O
that O
his B-problem
dementing I-problem
illness I-problem
and O
rigidity B-problem
was O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
some O
type O
of O
cortico-basal B-problem
ganglia I-problem
degeneration I-problem
process I-problem
, O
but O
this O
was O
not O
clarified O
during O
this O
admission O
. O

It O
was O
not O
felt O
likely O
to O
be O
due O
to O
Parkinson B-problem
&apos;s I-problem
disease I-problem
, O
as O
he O
had O
no O
significant B-problem
response I-problem
to I-problem
Eldopa I-problem
in O
the O
past O
and O
the O
patient O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
tremor B-problem
, O
although O
he O
was O
quite B-problem
rigid I-problem
and I-problem
bradykinetic I-problem
. O

He O
had O
an B-test
magnetic I-test
resonance I-test
imaging I-test
performed O
on O
October O
18 O
, O
1996 O
. O

This O
showed O
the B-problem
unchanged I-problem
left I-problem
temporal I-problem
parenchymal I-problem
interparenchymal I-problem
hematoma I-problem
and O
the B-problem
old I-problem
embolic I-problem
right I-problem
frontal I-problem
infarct I-problem
, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
new B-problem
lesions I-problem
and O
no O
evidence O
of O
his B-test
susceptibility I-test
studies I-test
to O
suggest O
old B-problem
bleeds I-problem
which O
might O
have O
been O
consistent O
with O
amylase B-problem
angiopathy I-problem
. O

In O
addition O
, O
he B-test
gadolinium I-test
scan I-test
did O
not O
show O
enhancement O
at O
the O
area O
of O
his B-problem
hemorrhage I-problem
, O
so O
tumor B-problem
was O
felt O
to O
be O
unlikely O
. O

However O
, O
this O
issue O
will O
need O
to O
be O
re-evaluated O
in O
six O
months O
time O
once O
the B-problem
hematoma I-problem
is O
less O
prominent O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
possibly O
an B-problem
underlying I-problem
tumor I-problem
or O
arterial B-problem
venous I-problem
malformation I-problem
that O
could O
be O
currently O
compressed O
by O
the O
area O
of O
hemorrhage B-problem
. O

The O
etiology O
of O
his B-problem
bleed I-problem
was O
felt O
to O
be O
most O
likely O
secondary O
to O
hypertension B-problem
, O
but O
these O
other O
causes O
could O
also O
not O
be O
ruled O
out O
. O

2) O
CARDIOVASCULAR O
: O

His B-test
electrocardiogram I-test
was O
concerning O
for O
ischemia B-problem
. O

He O
was O
on O
intravenous B-treatment
TNG I-treatment
and O
was O
supratherapeutic O
on O
his B-treatment
anti-coagulation I-treatment
. O

He O
did O
have O
a B-problem
slight I-problem
elevation I-problem
of I-problem
his I-problem
TPK I-problem
with O
an B-test
additional I-test
value I-test
of O
198 O
with O
a B-test
MB I-test
fraction I-test
of O
5.7 O
, O
which O
makes O
for O
a O
percentage O
of O
2.9 O
. O

That O
was O
at O
the O
highest O
percentage O
that O
he O
had O
and O
after O
this O
his O
percentage O
came O
down O
to O
1.6 O
, O
1.0 O
on O
subsequent B-treatment
CKMBs I-treatment
and O
was O
felt O
that O
he O
had O
a B-problem
very I-problem
small I-problem
&quot; I-problem
leaflet I-problem
&quot; I-problem
. O

He O
remained O
chest B-problem
pain I-problem
free O
throughout O
his O
admission O
. O

3) O
PULMONARY O
: O

After O
his B-treatment
initial I-treatment
intubation I-treatment
he O
remained O
quite O
stable O
. O

He O
was O
found O
to O
be O
at O
a B-problem
large I-problem
aspiration I-problem
risk I-problem
given O
his B-problem
decreased I-problem
mental I-problem
status I-problem
and O
the O
lack O
of O
presence O
of O
a B-test
gag I-test
reflex I-test
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
given O
aggressive B-treatment
pulmonary I-treatment
toilets I-treatment
including O
chest B-treatment
physical I-treatment
therapy I-treatment
and O
aspiration B-treatment
precautions I-treatment
and O
the O
patient O
did O
not O
develop O
any B-problem
pulmonary I-problem
symptoms I-problem
during O
his O
admission O
. O

4) O
HEMATOLOGY O
: O

He O
had O
his B-test

reversed O
with O
Vitamin B-treatment

mgs O
on O
admission O
subcutaneously O

the O

room O
. O

His B-treatment
anticoagulation I-treatment
status O
had O
to O
be O
monitored O
very O
closely O
due O
to O
his O
history O
of O
deep B-problem
venous I-problem
thrombosis I-problem
and O
pulmonary B-problem
embolus I-problem
as O
well O
as O
atrial B-problem
fibrillation I-problem
, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
be O
placed O
on O
a O
high O
amount O
of O
anticoagulation B-treatment
because O
of O
the B-problem
new I-problem
intraparenchymal I-problem
bleed I-problem
. O

It O
was O
decided O
that O
his B-test
goal I-test
INR I-test
was O
to O
be O
2.0 O
. O

He O
did O
drop O
below O
1.5 O
at O
one O
time O
, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
was O
placed O
on O
heparin B-treatment
intravenous I-treatment
to O
carry O
him O
through O
that O
period O
, O
but O
his B-test
discharge I-test
INR I-test
was O
around O
2 O
and O
he O
was O
off O
of O
heparin B-treatment
at O
that O
time O
. O

It O
was O
decided O
that O
he O
would O
have O
very O
close O
monitoring O
of O
his B-treatment
anticoagulation I-treatment
status O
in O
the O
future O
to O
prevent O
further B-problem
problems I-problem
. O

5) O
GASTROINTESTINAL O
: O

He O
was O
evaluated O
by O
the O
speech O
and O
swallow O
pathology O
group O
at O
the O
Ph O
University O
Of O
Medical O
Center O
and O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
swallow O
on O
his O
own O
with O
a O
soft O
solid O
diet O
with O
supervision O
. O

Thus O
, O
his B-treatment
nasogastric I-treatment
tube I-treatment
was O
discontinued O
on O
October O
19 O
, O
1996 O
and O
he O
tolerated O
feeding O
quite O
well O
. O

In O
discussions O
with O
the O
family O
, O
given O
his O
age O
and O
number O
of O
medical B-problem
problems I-problem
, O
it O
was O
decided O
that O
the O
patient O
should O
be O
do O
not O
resuscitate O
should O
he O
have O
a B-problem
terminal I-problem
cardiac I-problem
event I-problem
during O
his O
admission O
or O
during O
future O
admissions O
. O

However O
, O
he O
was O
still O
an B-treatment
intubation I-treatment
candidate O
if O
it O
were O
felt O
to O
be O
a B-treatment
short I-treatment
term I-treatment

. O

The O
family O
realizes O
that O
the O
long O
term O
outlook O
for O
this O
patient O
is O
not O
very O
good O
, O
but O
they O
would O
like O
to O
currently O
continue O
to O
provide O
him O
with O
all B-treatment
support I-treatment
necessary I-treatment
, O
short O
of O
resuscitation B-treatment
measures I-treatment
or O

and O
her B-problem

were O
banded O
. O

On O
transfer O
to O
the O
Lemgarson O
Hospital O
service O
, O
her B-test
hematocrit I-test
was O
31.2 O
, O

and O
a B-test

Her B-test
PT I-test
was O

, O
PTT B-test
26.7 O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
her B-test
labs I-test
were O
unremarkable O
. O

She O
was O
watched O
very O
closely O
while O
on O
the O
floor O
. O

She O
was O
on O
GI B-treatment
bleed I-treatment
precautions I-treatment
at O
all O
times O
, O
was O
too O
large O
for O
IV B-treatment
. O

She O
had O
a B-problem
clot I-problem
at O
the B-test
blood I-test
bank O
and O
she O
had O
BID O
hematocrits B-test
checked O
. O

She O
was O
kept O
NPO B-treatment
until O
January O
26 O
when O
she O
began O
to O
feel O
hungry O
. O

At O
that O
time O
clear B-treatment
liquids I-treatment
were O
started O
. O

All O
of O
her O
stools O
were O
guaiaced O
. O

She O
also O
began O
Nadolol B-treatment
40 O
mg O
QD O
to O
reduce O
her B-problem
portal I-problem
hypertension I-problem
. O

The O
GI O
consult O
team O
continued O
to O
follow O
her O
. O

We O
also O
tried O
to O
contact O
her O
physician O
at O
Va O
Sit O
Namar O
Healthcare O
and O
was O
unsuccessful O
. O

Therefore O
we O
decided O
to O
work O
up O
her B-problem
cirrhosis I-problem
. O

She O
was O
described O
as O
having O
_______ B-problem
cirrhosis I-problem
and O
we O
decided O
that O
we O
wanted O
to O
try O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
etiology O
. O

Her B-test
ferritin I-test
and O
iron B-test
studies I-test
did O
not O
reveal O
any O
evidence O
of O
hemochromatosis B-problem
and O
her B-test
hep I-test
serologies I-test
were O
all O
negative O
. O

She O
also O
had O
negative O
antimitochondrial B-test
antibody I-test
and O
she O
also O
had O
no O
evidence O
of O
ceruloplasmin B-problem
. O

Over O
the O
course O
of O
her O
admission O
were O
also O
sent O
an B-test
alpha-1-antitrypsin I-test
, O
which O
was O
negative O
. O

She O
did O
very O
well O
over O
the O
course O
of O
her O
admission O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
further B-problem
bleeding I-problem
. O

Her B-test
hematocrit I-test
stayed O
stable O
at O
approximately O
32 O
. O

We O
also O
did O
an B-test
ultrasound I-test
guided I-test
paracentesis I-test
. O

The B-test
peritoneal I-test
fluid I-test
showed O
a B-test
glucose I-test
of O
244 O
, O
total B-test
protein I-test
0.8 O
and O
a B-test
albumin I-test
of O
0.5 O
, O
globulin B-test
0.3 O
, O
amylase B-test
16 O
, O
LDH B-test
of O
51 O
. O

The B-test
serum I-test
albumin I-test
gradient I-test
was O
1.8 O
consistent O
with O
portal B-problem
hypertension I-problem
. O

The B-test
cell I-test
count I-test
showed O
a B-test
white I-test
blood I-test
cell I-test
count I-test
of O
160 O
with O
16% O
polys O
. O

She O
therefore O
_________ O
criteria O
for O
a B-problem
spontaneous I-problem
bacterial I-problem
peritonitis I-problem
. O

Her B-test
platelet I-test
count I-test
stayed O
persistently B-problem
low I-problem
and O
we O
decided O
that O
it O
might O
be O
due O
to O
Cimetidine B-treatment
. O

Therefore O
we O
switched O
her B-treatment
Cimetidine I-treatment
to O
Prilosec B-treatment
. O

By O
the O
2th O
the O
patient O
was O
feeling O
very O
well O
and O
desired O
to O
transfer O
or O
discharge O
to O
home O
. O

She O
wanted O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
North O
Dakota O
. O

HISTORY O
OF O
PRESENT O
ILLNESS O
: O

The O
patient O
is O
a O
25 O
year O
old O
who O
has O
a O
history O
of O
a B-problem
gunshot I-problem
wound I-problem
many O
years O
ago O
and O
has O
had O
multiple B-treatment
surgical I-treatment
procedures I-treatment
since O
then O
. O

Most O
recently O
he O
was O
admitted O
to O
an O
outside O
hospital O
with O
a B-problem
drug I-problem
overdose I-problem
in O
adult B-problem
respiratory I-problem
distress I-problem
syndrome I-problem
and O
ultimately O
found O
to O
have O
Candidal B-problem
pericarditis I-problem
which O
eventually O
led O
to O
constrictive B-problem
pericarditis I-problem
. O

He O
had O
a O
pericardial O
window O
. O

He O
had O
a B-treatment
barium I-treatment
swallow I-treatment
and O
endoscopy B-test
and O
was O
said O
not O
to O
have O
gastric B-problem
or O
pericardial B-problem
ulcer I-problem
. O

He O
had O
previous B-treatment
substernal I-treatment
gastric I-treatment
bypass I-treatment
because O
of O
an B-problem
interruption I-problem
of I-problem
his I-problem
esophagus I-problem
at O
the O
time O
of O
his B-problem
gunshot I-problem
wound I-problem
. O

He O
had O
been O
noted O
to O
have O
an B-problem
ulcer I-problem
and O
ultimately O
when O
he O
stabilized O
it O
was O
our O
feeling O
that O
he O
most O
likely O
had O
a B-problem
gastric I-problem
pericardial I-problem
ulcer I-problem
and O
he O
was O
transferred O
here O
for O
further B-treatment
management I-treatment
. O

We O
discussed O
the O
risks O
with O
his O
family O
. O

It O
was O
a B-problem
very I-problem
high I-problem
risk I-problem
in O
very B-problem
poor I-problem
condition I-problem
and O
a B-problem
cachectic I-problem
malnourished I-problem
edematous I-problem
individuals O
who O
have O
very B-problem
high I-problem
venous I-problem
pressures I-problem
and O
shortness B-problem
of I-problem
breath I-problem
. O

The O
family O
understood O
that O
this O
was O
a B-treatment
life I-treatment
saving I-treatment
procedure I-treatment
and O
only O
carried O
with O
it O
approximately O
50% O
chance O
of O
success O
. O
